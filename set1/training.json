The stanza that begins with, \"I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky/Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity...\" exemplifies the side effects that are common with the drug LSD in that strange hallucinations are being reported by whoever the song is about. Secondly, the mentioning of the drug speed is taken literally here, for Mercury sings the lines, \"I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva/I'm gonna go go go...\" He then goes into the chorus, which has lines, \"Two hundred degrees/That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit\" and, \"Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time/I'm having a ball...\" The first part of the chorus constitutes that the song's subject is \"baked\" -- a term suggesting that one under the influence of drugs is experiencing the consequences. The second part of the chorus, where he speaks of having a 'good time,' also contributes to the theme of the response to drugs. After the chorus, Mercury sings, \"Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars/On a collision course...\" which is a nod to marijuana because it make people \"high,\" like a rocket in space. As a mention to the final drug, ecstasy, the song has the lines, \"I am a sex machine ready to reload/Like an atom bomb about to/Oh oh oh oh oh explode...\" the link here is obvious.", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Overall, this song is, quite simply, about the cheerful first-person account of doing drugs.", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "joshuah111", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "on December 24, 2015", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "No Replies", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Log in to reply", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "+2", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "General Comment", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "This song makes me feel INVINCIBLE.", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "TFFMO", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "on January 21, 2006", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "No Replies", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Log in to reply", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "+2", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "General Comment", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "He's bi, who cares?", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "lxpnh98", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "on April 01, 2014", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "No Replies", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Log in to reply", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "+1", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "General Comment", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "i love this song, i think its just about being young and having your life ahead of u but i dont know.", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "sue", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "-x-", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "deafworm", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "on June 14, 2002", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "No Replies", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Log in to reply", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "+1", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "General Comment", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "The song doesn't need any real explaining - it just rocks.", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Ar3s", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "on April 09, 2003", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "No Replies", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Log in to reply", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "+1", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "General Comment", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time!!", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "lorababe_17", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "on April 30, 2003", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Link", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "No Replies", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Log in to reply", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "+1", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "General Comment", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "Now this is my interpretation.

Now, obviously the music video is very cool, and I think it's confusing enough that there will be a continuous conversation about what exactly is going on there. We see Josh Taylor playing this dad; and he's being sent off to war back in the 1940s perhaps; and he's kind of trying to connect with his daughter, and she won't really talk to him, because maybe she feels abandoned, or maybe they just don't have a great relationship; he seems like a good dad though; but he leaves the little girl some letters, and he puts inside one of the envelopes his ring too; we don't see the mum at all in the video, by the way; so, he heads off to war, and I think it's implied that he doesn't come back; and so years and years later, she's in her apartment, as she's grown up; and it looks like it might be the 1970s; so she's reading these letters left by him; she sees the ring; then the room starts to close in on her; and I think that it's probably a picture of what a child may go through, when they feel abandoned by their parents, but realize that there was an actual good relationship there all along; like, you know, her dad actually cared for her; but he didn't really have a choice about being drafted.", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "", "isLyric": false}, {"text": "That is the basic storyline; I think there's a deeper meaning to it; and I'd love to hear your thoughts on that; but what I really want to talk about today are the lyrics themselves. \"RUNAWAY\" has got this strong message, and it's about something that I've been personally thinking about a lot lately; which made this song especially painful/good to be surprised by what the song was about; it is this kind of balance between who you want to be, and who you are. The first few stanzas of the song don't give anything away; but as you get further into the chorus, into the second verse, and so on; you start to see like this pretty strong message develop; and it's especially interesting to look at this difference between who you want to be, and who you are; which I guarantee you, you've thought about that, you're struggling with that; you probably feel like maybe there's something wrong with you, and if only you were a little bit different, you'd be better or something; or like in my case, it's a lot of \"well if I accomplish this, I'd be where I want to be\", yeah? Unfortunately, I haven't figured out the balance personally; I don't think that it's the kind of thing where you just be like \"Okay, I'm exactly cool with exactly who I am\"; but as my wife talks to me about it a lot, I don't think that we really need to spend the rest of our lives always trying to get something better.

"This songs seem to be about a relationship that is very meaningful.

She seems to be talking out of anger. And my favorite part is ''We sink, we lift our love''. It is a nice contrast with the rest of the chorus that sounds spiteful.
