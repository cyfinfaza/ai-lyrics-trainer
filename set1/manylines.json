    "‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù is one of Queen‚Äôs masterpieces, a song that‚Äôs aged well with time and landed third on Rolling Stone‚Äôs list of the Top 10 Queen Songs. It‚Äôs a simple song, an energetic song that sees lead singer Freddie Mercury on a high that he wants to stay in, letting nobody pull him down.",
    "",
    "Critically, the song performed well, releasing as a single after the release of album Jazz. Despite reaching number 9 on the UK charts and later going Platinum, it only hit 86 on the US charts. Time has only increased its popularity, as it is often included in ‚ÄúGreatest Hit‚Äù compilations and stands as their second most played song on Spotify with over 750 million plays as of January 2020.",

    "Brian May spoke with Absolute Radio in 2011, \"It's become almost the most successful Queen track as regards to what people play in their car or at their weddings.

    "\"Don't Stop Me Now\" is a song by the British rock band Queen from their 1978 album Jazz and released as a single in 1979. Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it was recorded in August 1978 at Super Bear Studios in Berre-les-Alpes (Alpes-Maritimes), France, and is the twelfth track on the album. Musically, the song builds on Mercury's piano playing, with John Deacon and Roger Taylor providing a bass guitar and drums backing track. The song also provides an example of Queen's trademark style of multitrack harmony vocals for the chorus lines. ¬†more ¬ª",

    "Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1971, originally consisting of the late Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music. After the late and great Freddie Mercury died, Queen continued to tour with multiple acts including Paul Rodgers, and currently, Adam Lambert. more ¬ª",

    "\"Don't Stop Me Now\" is a song by the British rock band Queen from their 1978 album Jazz and released as a single in 1979. Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it was recorded in August 1978 at Super Bear Studios in Berre-les-Alpes (Alpes-Maritimes), France, and is the twelfth track on the album. Musically, the song builds on Mercury's piano playing, with John Deacon and Roger Taylor providing a bass guitar and drums backing track. The song also provides an example of Queen's trademark style of multitrack harmony vocals for the chorus lines. ¬†more ¬ª",

Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music. After the late and great Freddie Mercury died, Queen continued to tour with multiple acts including Paul Rodgers, and currently, Adam Lambert. more ¬ª",

    "My Interpretation",
    "This song, I believe, is about someone's experience with four drugs: LSD, Speed, Marijuana, and Ecstasy.",
    "If we start off with the mood of the song, we notice that the song is fast, happy, and even motivational in some aspects. While this is not enough to properly create the summary that the song is based off of drugs, it contributes to the theme.",
    "Now, if we go to the lyrical content, we see that the link between the song and drugs is pretty strong. The stanza that begins with, \"I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky/Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity...\" exemplifies the side effects that are common with the drug LSD in that strange hallucinations are being reported by whoever the song is about. Secondly, the mentioning of the drug speed is taken literally here, for Mercury sings the lines, \"I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva/I'm gonna go go go...\" He then goes into the chorus, which has lines, \"Two hundred degrees/That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit\" and, \"Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time/I'm having a ball...\" The first part of the chorus constitutes that the song's subject is \"baked\" -- a term suggesting that one under the influence of drugs is experiencing the consequences. The second part of the chorus, where he speaks of having a 'good time,' also contributes to the theme of the response to drugs. After the chorus, Mercury sings, \"Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars/On a collision course...\" which is a nod to marijuana because it make people \"high,\" like a rocket in space. As a mention to the final drug, ecstasy, the song has the lines, \"I am a sex machine ready to reload/Like an atom bomb about to/Oh oh oh oh oh explode...\" the link here is obvious.",
    "Overall, this song is, quite simply, about the cheerful first-person account of doing drugs.",

    "The concept for the¬†\"RUNAWAY\"¬†music video all came from our imaginations. All three of us collaborated in writing the concept, and¬†Josh¬†spearheaded the story as the director and primary visionary. The real connection between the song and the video comes from the chorus lyrics:¬†\"I find that everything I am is everything I should be, I don‚Äôt need to run away.‚Äú¬†In the video, the daughter, Jess has been running away from her true identity as a beloved child her entire life. Her father, Francis, who got drafted in WWII knew that he might never come back, so he wrote a series of letters to her, intending for her to open one on each birthday for 20 years.¬† Inside were words of affirmation and guidance, telling her who she really is and where she can find her confidence from.¬† But Jess was furious with her father for leaving, so she didn‚Äôt open the letters until her 24th¬†birthday.¬† It then when she understood her father‚Äôs love for her, and subsequently, who she was in light of that.¬† Finally, she realizes,¬†\"I don‚Äôt need to RUNAWAY.‚Äù",

    "What does \"RUNAWAY\" by half‚Ä¢alive mean?",
    "Clifford Stumme",
    "‚ÄúRUNAWAY‚Äù Lyrics Meaning",
    "",
    "(The following blog post is a transcript created by Xalma of the below video.)",
    "",
    "Today we're talking about \"RUNAWAY\" by half‚Ä¢alive; this song was written by the frontman, Josh Taylor; and I just want to talk about this; because I don't think I've had a song affect me this emotionally in a while; there's some really good and some really deep stuff here. Now, obviously the music video is very cool, and I think it's confusing enough that there will be a continuous conversation about what exactly is going on there. We see Josh Taylor playing this dad; and he's being sent off to war back in the 1940s perhaps; and he's kind of trying to connect with his daughter, and she won't really talk to him, because maybe she feels abandoned, or maybe they just don't have a great relationship; he seems like a good dad though; but he leaves the little girl some letters, and he puts inside one of the envelopes his ring too; we don't see the mum at all in the video, by the way; so, he heads off to war, and I think it's implied that he doesn't come back; and so years and years later, she's in her apartment, as she's grown up; and it looks like it might be the 1970s; so she's reading these letters left by him; she sees the ring; then the room starts to close in on her; and I think that it's probably a picture of what a child may go through, when they feel abandoned by their parents, but realize that there was an actual good relationship there all along; like, you know, her dad actually cared for her; but he didn't really have a choice about being drafted.",
    "",
    "That is the basic storyline; I think there's a deeper meaning to it; and I'd love to hear your thoughts on that; but what I really want to talk about today are the lyrics themselves. \"RUNAWAY\" has got this strong message, and it's about something that I've been personally thinking about a lot lately; which made this song especially painful/good to be surprised by what the song was about; it is this kind of balance between who you want to be, and who you are. The first few stanzas of the song don't give anything away; but as you get further into the chorus, into the second verse, and so on; you start to see like this pretty strong message develop; and it's especially interesting to look at this difference between who you want to be, and who you are; which I guarantee you, you've thought about that, you're struggling with that; you probably feel like maybe there's something wrong with you, and if only you were a little bit different, you'd be better or something; or like in my case, it's a lot of \"well if I accomplish this, I'd be where I want to be\", yeah? Unfortunately, I haven't figured out the balance personally; I don't think that it's the kind of thing where you just be like \"Okay, I'm exactly cool with exactly who I am\"; but as my wife talks to me about it a lot, I don't think that we really need to spend the rest of our lives always trying to get something better. Yes, it's a complicated topic that I haven't figured out myself yet.",

    "I've been tripping, no one's perfect",
    "Chasing vision, just the surface",

    "So he's trying to get something more out of life; he's looking for it, but he just feels like he's getting a surface-level stuff; and there's that vision of what he wants to be, or what life should be like, what he should be doing.",

    "",
    "So he found something good, right? like something big happened. I don't remember from when I first started explaining his songs where is the faith basis for him, and whether \"heaven\" actually means anything to him on a religious side; but at the very least, it's a metaphor for something bigger, that's speaking into his life; so it seems like he sees some sort of an epiphany here.",

    "He's looking in the mirror; and he's going to think about his perfectionism; but he's not going to try to apply it to him. The second line might actually be an evidence that there is some sort of a religious influence for him; but he is saying there's this promise, and the promises that it is well, maybe it is well with my soul, and he's trying to say \"who I am is okay, and I don't need to constantly be trying to perfect myself\".",

    "",
    "I think that just says everything, \"I find that everything I am, is everything I should be\", what a thing to be able to say! If you could honestly say that, completely in with your whole heart, you would be the happiest person in the entire world; and then to say \"I don't need to run away from who I am\", which is what he's saying there; like, man! Man, that is some next-level stuff, guys.",
    "",
    "There's not a whole lot to explain here; it's just deep, it's just big... it is beautiful.",

    "Go, tell me now!",
    "I don't need to run away",
    "",
    "So things are starting to get better as he starts to accept who he is, right? And hey, it's just so tempting to go ahead and try to apply all this stuff to my life; and to start really thinking about this; but the basic gist of that, \"what I am is something more than I can plan\"; you are bigger than what you can dream of you could be; and it's not \"you're going to become something bigger than what you could dream of what you could be\"; he's saying that who he is, the the value of him intrinsically, that is bigger than what he could dream of him becoming; which. is. just. something. else. oh. my. gosh!",
    "",
    "You're kind of reading what I'm trying to explain, while also internalizing it heavily, and just being like *sigh*. This couldn't come at a better time for just some of the thoughts and things that I've been going through recently. I am sure that most of you guys can really get what I am saying, because you're probably having or have had the same inner struggles and thoughts too.",

    "No, I don't need to run away",
    "",
    "And I think when you see those empty pages; you feel this pressure to fill them with the right thing; and you know, he talks about perfection; that urge to become the perfect person, right? And just for him to kind of come to this realization, that he doesn't have to run away from who he is, and run away towards who he thinks he should be, man! Josh Taylor, I doubt that anyone ever fully believes this. I think that probably your life is a process of coming to grips with an idea like this, if you're lucky, or if you have healthy influences. That's some really really good stuff, guys.",
    "",
    "So, half‚Ä¢alive, Josh Taylor, that is awesome. And yeah, you're a fool if you don't go watch the music video, listen to this song, read the lyrics, and think about it yourself; because there's some really deep stuff there; and I would really like you guys to do something for me; go through the lyrics, find your favourite line, the one line that speaks to you the most; and comment it down below; because I really want to see if it has the same power for you, that it has for me. Like am I the only one? Is that because this just speaks to the way that I feel screwed up is a person? or is this like a universal thing? Please let me know, guys.",

    "This song's title was revealed by the Chainsmokers on Instagram in February 2018. 'Takeaway' is the fifth single from the album.",
    "An early version of 'Takeaway' was performed by the Chainsmokers and Illenium during Ultra Miami on the 31st of March 2019. The female vocals were provided by Sorana, and the song was shorter than the final version featuring Lennon Stella.",
    "The official 15-second video teaser of this song was published on the 17th of July 2019.",
    "The music video for 'Takeaway' was filmed in New York City and it features the Vessel, a sculpture at Hudson Yards. The Chainsmokers shared their experience by saying the following, \"We are so lucky to have had the opportunity to be one of the first artists to create a music video with The Vessel! We are from New York so to be a part of something that will be a huge part of New York City history is incredibly special to us.\"",

    "Ascend has been epically wonderful. In fact, for the last two days I haven't been listening to any other album.",
    "",
    "Amongst all these songs, one song that really caught my attention was Takeaway. I had listened to it earlier with The Chainsmokers' release. However the lyrics really caught my attention this time.",
    "",
    "What do the lyrics actually mean? Is it about someone betraying his significant other because they are afraid of being hurt? And what does the line, \"Your heart for a takeaway\" mean? I didn't get it at all.",

    "\"Me!\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift featuring American singer Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco. It was released on April 26, 2019, through Republic Records, as Swift's first single after signing with the label. The song was revealed and released at the end of a thirteen-day countdown, as the lead single from her seventh studio album, Lover (2019). It was written by Swift, Joel Little and Urie, and produced by Swift and Little. The song was recorded at Electric Lady Studios, New York City and Golden Age West in Auckland, New Zealand in 2018. \"Me!\" is a cheery, campy bubblegum pop and synth-pop duet, driven by a marching band drumline. It is about embracing one's individuality, with lyrics on self-affirmation and self-love.",
    "",
    "\"Me!\" debuted at number 100 on the US Billboard Hot 100 before surging up to number 2 the next week, breaking the record for the biggest single-week jump in the chart's history. The song reached the top three in several other countries. It broke four Amazon Music records, including the most first-day streams, most first-week streams and most on-demand voice requests with Alexa of a single debut on the platform. Upon release, the song received mixed reviews from music critics, who were favorable towards the bubbly production and the duo's vocal chemistry, but divided over the lyrics‚Äîsome complimented the tongue-in-cheek songwriting, while others called it weak. In July 2019, \"Me!\" was certified double-platinum by Recording Industry Association of America, for selling over 2 million copies in the US. In 2020, the single won the Hito Music Award for Best Western Song. A live version of the song recorded at Swift's 2019 City of Lover concert in Paris was released for digital download and streaming on May 17, 2020, after the premiere of the concert film on ABC.",
    "",
    "The \"Me!\" music video, directed by Swift and Dave Meyers, accompanied the song's release. Encompassing a number of easter eggs, the colorful video is a symbolic departure from the previous album Reputation (2017), welcoming into the Lover era. It has been described as a \"phantasmagorical delight\" that induces an instant \"sugar rush\" in a \"bubblegum psychedelia\". The video amassed over 65.2 million views within its first day of release, breaking the 24-hour Vevo record previously held by Ariana Grande's \"Thank U, Next\", also surpassing Swift's personal record set in 2017 with the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video, which garnered 43.2 million views in its first day. The video scored several accolades; it won a VMA for Best Visual Effects at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, the Best Video at the 2019 MTV Europe Music Awards and the Best Female International Artist Video at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards Japan.",

    "Swift posing in front of the interactive butterfly mural in The Gulch, Nashville, Tennessee on April 25, 2019, where she revealed that the thirteen-day countdown is indeed related to her new music. The mural included the title of the lead single, \"Me!\", which was released at midnight.",
    "",
    "On April 13, 2019, a countdown to midnight on April 26 appeared on Taylor Swift's website, leading to speculation about the release of new music.[1] On April 25, various news outlets reported that a mural of a butterfly in The Gulch neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee, painted by street artist Kelsey Montague,[2] was connected with the upcoming release.[3] A crowd of several hundred gathered at the mural as the word \"Me!\" was added to it by Montague.[3][4] While Montague was initially told that the mural was commissioned as promotion for ABC, ESPN and the 2019 NFL Draft,[5] Swift appeared at the mural and revealed that it was in fact part of her countdown promotion and that she would be interviewed by Robin Roberts during the NFL Draft broadcast with further information.[6] At the interview she confirmed the release of a new song and music video at midnight, sharing the title as well as the feature from Urie.[7]",

    "",
    "Critical reception[edit]",
    "",
    "\"Me!\" received polarizing reviews from music critics. Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield called the song \"campy\", \"bubbly\" and \"a totally canonical Taylor Lead Single\", due in respect to her past lead singles differing sonically from their respective albums.[16] Rob Harvilla of The Ringer opined \"'Me!' is a cloyingly goofy Disney-pop confection with an earworm chorus and a certain try-hard insidiousness to it\".[17] Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz stated that it \"is similarly shiny, and the tongue-in-cheek self-assessment of 'Blank Space' shows up in the verses, but it's also much more broad, way more cheerful and delivered without an ounce of sarcasm or snark\".[18] Forbes' Hugh McIntyre wrote that it \"isn't just a pop song, it's the momentary escape we all need\".[19] Erin Vanderhoof of Vanity Fair called it \"pretty anodyne but catchy\" and praised the collaboration between Swift and Urie.[20] Roisin O'Connor of The Independent wrote that \"Swift once again proves her mastery of the infectious pop hook in one of the most drastic reinventions of her career to date\".[21] Time's Raisa Bruner commended that Swift \"veers away from her normally specific songwriting to instead offer up an anthem of self-love\", and added that even though it \"doesn't hit the emotional notes of her [Swift's] most memorable work, it makes a strong statement\".[11]",
    "",
    "In an article titled \"'ME!' Is Everything Wrong With Pop\", The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber wrote that the song \"has almost none of the elements that once made [Swift] interesting, but it does have a dolphin screech for a chorus\".[22] Writing for Pitchfork, Anna Gaca stated that it \"is a showcase for the worst and weakest aspects of Swift's work\", and added \"it is not hard to write a better song than this\".[23] NME's Rhian Daly wrote that the lyrics of \"Me!\" \"are just surface messaging about self-love and acceptance, the kind of hollow #positivity that is slapped on greeting cards and slogan t-shirts and sold as empowering\".[24] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood stated that the song features \"her weakest lyrics ever\" and that \"nothing about this song advances our thinking about Swift\".[25] Slate's Carl Wilson called it \"fluffy and immaterial\", adding that Swift and Urie \"just traipse through a kiss-and-make-up number out of a teen musical\".[26] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Kate Solomon opined that \"she's concocted what might be her most pop song to date,\" and went on to say that \"the low point might be Swift shouting out, 'Spelling is fun, kids!' like a manic summer camp counsellor because she's noticed that 'you can‚Äôt spell awesome without me'\".[27] The Spinoff's Alice Webb-Liddall wrote \"I was prepared to like it until Taylor yelled 'Spelling is fun' and from that point in the video I felt a little bit sick\".[28] Matthew McAuley from the same magazine opined that Urie \"pulled out all of the stops to try and ruin this one\".[28] Writing for The Independent, Alexandra Pollard stated that the song is \"so blandly uncontroversial that there is literally nothing to say about it\", and that it \"has proven something of a damp squib\".[9]",

    "Swift has stated that there are multiple Easter eggs in the video, and that there are three levels of them in the video, from most obvious to least obvious, which point to clues about the upcoming album, single, and tour. It was revealed that \"You Need to Calm Down\", a line Urie says to Swift at the beginning in French, would be the second single, and an \"old-timey, 1940s-sounding instrumental version\" of the song plays in the background in the same scene.[54] The album title Lover[55] was correctly guessed in advance.[56] Other potential titles that were speculated of being on the album were \"Kaleidoscope\",[57] \"Home\"[58] and \"Awesome\".[59] The portrait of The Chicks was later revealed to be a reference to a collaboration for the song \"Soon You'll Get Better\" on the album.[60]",

    "Swift sits on a unicorn-shaped eave as the dress turns into a waterfall. The word \"Lover\" in the background was an example of Easter eggs that Swift placed in the video, as it was later revealed to be the album title.",
    "",
    "The setting of the video seems to be set within a chrysalis.[63] The music video opens with a snake slithering on a floor which then explodes into a group of colourful butterflies, a probable benchmark to note the end of her previous era, Reputation, where snakes were a motif, and welcoming the inception of the upcoming one.[63] The video pans up to show Swift and Urie engaging in an argument in French, with subtitles provided, in an apartment unit, in which Swift refers to her cats Meredith and Olivia as her \"daughters\". Swift is wearing a black and white tule dress with floral accents (which is similar to the black and white dress worn by actress Grace Kelly in the film Rear Window).[64] Swift then leaves the room without Urie and starts singing the song upon closing the door in the hallway. Swift walks down the hallway, and the camera briefly cuts onto a group of framed artwork hung on the apartment of chicks in sunglasses and a portrait of The Chicks during the line \"and there's a lot of cool chicks out there\". Swift is then seen walking to the lobby accompanied with several thunderclouds, one of which is in the form of a snake that tries to swallow her up but turns to dust upon doing so. The video cuts to a scene where a suit-clad Swift dances with her backup dancers, who are holding office bags. Urie looks out onto the street from the apartment and jumps down the balcony on an umbrella Mary Poppins-style wearing a floral print suit.",
    "",
    "He lands on the roof of a building with a unicorn-shaped eave, where Swift is seen sitting at the edge with a pink dress that turns to a waterfall. This is where the Lover sign is spotted. Urie then tries and fails to win Swift over with classic and banal items such as a bouquet of flowers and a ring. He then awes her by presenting a cat, which Taylor later adopted as her third pet and named Benjamin Button. The camera cuts to Urie opening his heart, which is revealed to be a kaleidoscope. Swift has revealed on an Instagram livestream that this is a reference to her 2014 song, \"Welcome to New York\", where she sings \"kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats\".[65] Urie and Swift then sing on a heart-shaped pinkish-orange stage, joined with a band of angels and go-go dancers wearing 1960s mod style clothing. As the bridge plays, Swift and Urie don blue marching band uniforms and dance with a group of dancers in the same attire, but pink. The video then cuts to a scene of the duo dancing on a floating window with a psychedelic-esque background. The last scene then depicts Swift in a blue attire that melts into what seems to be liquid bubblegum while a running Urie summons the same rain-like pastel liquid around the street. The video ends with the duo entering the same apartment building with an umbrella as the bubblegum rain continues on the street in the night.",
    "",
    "In her Netflix documentary Miss Americana, Swift describes the concept of the music video to be related the song's message of individualism and self-empowerment by demonstrating hobbies and characteristics that make herself and Urie unique: emo kids and musical theatre for Urie and cats, gay pride, and cowboy boots for Swift.[66]",

    "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling and complex illness.",
    "",
    "People with ME/CFS are often not able to do their usual activities. At times, ME/CFS may confine them to bed. People with ME/CFS have overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by rest. ME/CFS may get worse after any activity, whether it‚Äôs physical or mental. This symptom¬†is known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). Other symptoms can include problems with sleep, thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness. People with ME/CFS may not look ill. However,",
    "",
    "People with ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill.",
    "ME/CFS changes people‚Äôs ability to do daily tasks, like taking a shower or preparing a meal.",
    "ME/CFS often makes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life.",
    "ME/CFS can last for years and sometimes leads to serious disability.",
    "At least one in four ME/CFS patients is bed- or house-bound for long periods during their illness.",
    "",
    "Anyone can get ME/CFS. While most common in people between 40 and 60 years old, the illness affects children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. Among adults, women are affected more often than men. Whites are diagnosed more than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among minorities.",
    "",
    "As noted in the IOM report:",
    "",
    "An estimated 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS.",
    "About 90 percent of people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed.",
    "ME/CFS costs the U.S. economy about $17 to $24 billion annually in medical bills and lost incomes.",
    "",
    "Some of the reasons that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed include limited access to healthcare and a lack of education about ME/CFS among healthcare providers.",
    "",
    "Most medical schools in the United States do not have ME/CFS as part of their physician training.",
    "The illness is often misunderstood and might not be taken seriously by some healthcare providers.",
    "More education for doctors and nurses is urgently needed so they are prepared to provide timely diagnosis and appropriate care for patients.",
    "",
    "Researchers have not yet found what causes¬†ME/CFS, and there are no specific laboratory tests to diagnose ME/CFS¬†directly. Therefore, doctors need to consider the diagnosis of ME/CFS based on in-depth evaluation of a person‚Äôs symptoms and medical history. It is also important that doctors diagnose and treat any other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Even though there is no cure for ME/CFS, some symptoms can be treated or managed.",

    "WHAT IS ME?",
    "",
    "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is a complex chronic disease that presents with symptoms in multiple body systems.¬† ME is a neurological disease according to the World Health Organization.¬†",
    "",
    "Susceptibility may be genetic, but the disease is triggered by infection in the majority of patients.¬† ME may be severe: 75% of those affected are unable to work and 25% are homebound or bedridden. ME is a common chronic consequence of viruses, with 10-12% of those with serious infection going on to develop the disease.¬† An estimated 15-30 million people live with the disease worldwide.",
    "",
    "The cardinal symptom of ME is post-exertional malaise (PEM), or post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion.¬† PEM is a flare of symptoms and/or the appearance of new symptoms after exertion, often presenting ~24 hours after the triggering event.¬† While PEM is often studied in relation to physical activity, cognitive overexertion or sensory overload may also initiate PEM.",
    "",
    "People with ME experience a substantial loss of physical and/or cognitive function. The average person with ME scores as more disabled on quality of life surveys than those with multiple sclerosis, stroke, diabetes, renal failure, lung disease, heart failure, and cancer.¬† Someone with mild ME may be able to work full-time with accommodations; someone with very severe ME may be bedbound and have trouble communicating.",
    "",
    "ME is a relapsing-remitting condition.¬† Individual patients experience significant fluctuations in their well-being from day to day, week to week, and month to month.",
    "",
    "PREVALENCE",
    "",
    "An estimated 15-30 million people around the world are suffering from ME including at least:",
    "",
    "1,000,000 Americans",
    "250,000 British people",
    "100,000 Australians",
    "560,000¬†Canadians",
    "An estimated¬†75-85% of them are women",
    "80-90% of them are undiagnosed",
    "SYMPTOMS",
    "",
    "The hallmark symptom of ME is¬†post-exertional malaise,¬†a reduction in functioning and a severe worsening of symptoms after even minimal physical or cognitive exertion.",
    "",
    "Other common symptoms include:",
    "",
    "Orthostatic intolerance",
    "Unrefreshing sleep",
    "Pain in the muscles and joints",
    "Headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity",
    "Cognitive symptoms such as confusion, difficulty retrieving words, poor working memory, spatial instability, and disorientation",
    "Sensitivity to light, sound or vibration, taste, odor or touch",
    "Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or abdominal pain",
    "Muscle fatigability, weakness and fasciculation; poor coordination and ataxia",
    "Autonomic and endocrine symptoms such as poor temperature regulation, cold or heat intolerance",
    "Immune symptoms such as tender lymph nodes, recurrent sore throats, fevers, or flu-like symptoms, and new food or chemical sensitivities",
    "DIAGNOSIS",
    "",
    "While there is no single laboratory test that can diagnose ME, patients have consistent biological abnormalities demonstrated in research settings. Many specialist physicians use these tests to aid in forming a diagnosis, although the diagnosis is at present most frequently made by excluding other conditions that cause similar symptoms and by using one of several sets of diagnostic criteria. Due to lack of education and awareness about ME, many patients are undiagnosed, or misdiagnosed with other conditions.",
    "",
    "TREATMENT",
    "",
    "There are no approved treatments for ME. Because many ME patients‚Äô symptoms vary over time, specialists often suggest treatments that are highly personalized.",

    "",
    "Me is used in many constructions where strict grammarians prescribe I. This usage is not so much ungrammatical as indicative of the shrinking range of the nominative form: me began to replace I sometime around the 16th century largely because of the pressure of word order. I is now chiefly used as the subject of an immediately following verb. Me occurs in every other position: absolutely  who, me?  , emphatically  me too  , and after prepositions, conjunctions, and verbs, including be.  come with me   you're as big as me   it's me  Almost all usage books recognize the legitimacy of me in these positions, especially in speech; some recommend I in formal and especially written contexts after be and after as and than when the first term of the comparison is the subject of a verb.",

    "GRAMMAR NOTES FOR ME",
    "2. A traditional rule governing the case of personal pronouns after forms of the verb to be is that the nominative or subjective form ( I; she; he; we; they ) must be chosen. Some 400 years ago, owing to the feeling that the postverb position in a sentence is object rather than subject territory, me and other objective pronouns ( him; her; us; them ) began to replace the subjective forms after be, so that It is I became It is me. Today such constructions‚Äî It's me. That's him. It must be them. ‚Äîare almost universal in speech, the context in which they usually occur. In formal speech or edited writing, the subjective forms are used: It was I who first noticed the problem. My brother was the one who called our attention to the problem, but it wasn't he who solved it. It had been she at the window, not her husband.",
    "Me and other objective forms have also replaced the subjective forms in speech in constructions like Me neither; Not us; Who, them? and in comparisons after as or than: She's no faster than him at getting the answers. When the pronoun is the subject of a verb that is expressed, the nominative forms are used: Neither did I. She's no faster than he is at getting the answers. See also than.",
    "3. When a verb form ending in -ing functions as a noun, it is traditionally called a gerund: Walking is good exercise. She enjoys reading biographies. Usage guides have long insisted that gerunds, being nouns, must be preceded by the possessive form of the pronouns or nouns ( my; your; her; his; its; our; their; child's; author's ) rather than by the objective forms ( me; you; him; her; it; us; them ): The landlord objected to my (not me ) having guests late at night. Several readers were delighted at the author's (not author ) taking a stand on the issue. In standard practice, however, both objective and possessive forms appear before gerunds. Possessives are more common in formal edited writing, but the occurrence of objective forms is increasing; in informal writing and speech objective forms are more common: Many objections have been raised to the government (or government's ) allowing lumbering in national parks. ‚ÄúDoes anyone object to me (or my ) reading this report aloud?‚Äù the moderator asked.",

    "There‚Äôs a story Thurgood Marshall loved to tell about the day the Supreme Court handed down its landmark 1958 decision in Cooper v. Aaron, ordering the integration of the public schools of Little Rock, Ark., and openly chastising state officials for seeking to interfere with the decrees of federal judges.",
    "",
    "Marshall argued the case, and the justices unanimously took his side. ‚ÄúThe constitutional rights of respondents,‚Äù wrote the court, ‚Äúare not to be sacrificed or yielded to the violence and disorder which have followed upon the actions of the Governor and Legislature.‚Äù Black people ‚Äî or Negroes, as he would have said ‚Äî were jubilant. After the decision was announced, Marshall climbed into a taxicab in New York, heading to a celebration. The Black driver had no idea who his passenger was, but seeing a well-dressed man of his own race, he asked if he‚Äôd heard about the verdict.",
    "",
    "Marshall grunted an affirmative.",
    "",
    "‚ÄúWhat a great day for our people!‚Äù the driver enthused.",
    "",
    "Marshall agreed.",
    "",
    "The driver broke into a smile. ‚ÄúGod bless Martin Luther King!‚Äù he cried.",
    "",
    "Marshall would chuckle as he recited the punchline. He wasn‚Äôt complaining. Even back in the 1950s, he‚Äôd had several lifetimes worth of recognition. But like all his stories, this one was intended to make a point: It was a reminder of how, in the popular image of the civil rights movement, protests are everything, and the law is a sideshow.",

    "Like that cabdriver, we‚Äôve overlooked vital chunks of history. Most of those people nowadays who consider Marshall a hero cherish his votes on the Supreme Court. They admire him not for who he was but for his usefulness to their causes.",
    "",
    "And he was indeed a reliable vote for broad, liberal interpretations of the Constitution on issues ranging from racial justice to abortion rights. Early in his tenure, he helped establish the modern understanding of the right to privacy, authoring the court‚Äôs unanimous 1969 opinion in Stanley v. Georgia, which upheld the freedom to possess pornographic materials for private use, a decision celebrated at the time, with a certain sexist nostalgia, as the ‚Äúman‚Äôs home is his castle‚Äù case. And although in the end Marshall did not prevail, he remained until his last day on the court its leading voice for the abolition of the death penalty.",

    "Yet there is something tragic and illiberal in evaluating other people according to their usefulness to our causes. In the particular case of Thurgood Marshall, remembering him only for his votes, or even for the remarkable success of his work as the leading civil rights litigator in the nation‚Äôs history, deprives us of the opportunity to admire the fullness of his humanity.",
    "",
    "This June marked the 30th anniversary of Marshall‚Äôs announcement that he was retiring from the bench. And although the realization makes me dizzy, it‚Äôs been over four decades since he hired me as one of his law clerks for the 1980 term of the Supreme Court.",
    "",
    "On and off for the next dozen years, I sat at the feet of the man his clerks used to call the Judge and listened, enthralled, to his stories. During the year I worked for him, the late afternoon was often story time, when he would settle in a convenient chair and, eyes bright with memory, share details of his extraordinary career. On later visits to the court, I would sit in his sunny, capacious office, eager to hear more. And during the last year of his life, the two of us spent a great deal of time together in the smaller upstairs chambers assigned to him upon his retirement, because he had asked me to serve as the interviewer for his official oral history for the Federal Judicial Center. Our conversations lasted countless hours but also all too few. The recordings remain sealed, but even outside the audio taping, we talked. Or, rather, the Judge talked; I listened and learned.",

    "Marshall was among the great storytellers, heir to an American tradition stretching back to Lincoln and beyond. He told stories to teach lessons ‚Äî and also like Lincoln, he never told the same story quite the same way twice. The message was what mattered.",
    "",

    "Marshall, center, with his client Autherine Lucy in Birmingham, Ala., in 1956.",
    "Credit...",
    " Gene Herrick/Associated Press",
    "",
    "So let‚Äôs consider some of his stories, and the lessons they taught. The first concerns a lawsuit that arose in the 1960s while Marshall was a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The plaintiff was well known in New York‚Äôs federal courts because she filed complaints regularly, the sort of complaints that claim that the government has installed electrodes in the plaintiff‚Äôs brain to steal her ideas for television shows ‚Äî things like that.",
    "",
    "Her lawsuits were always thrown out, her appeals always dismissed without a hearing. Anyone who has worked around the courts knows there‚Äôs no other way to handle a litigant in the throes of delusion.",
    "",
    "At this time, the chief judge of the circuit was J. Edward Lumbard. As Marshall told the story, Lumbard, without a word to anyone else, put the woman‚Äôs appeal on the calendar for oral argument. Nothing like this had happened before. Nobody could figure out what was going on.",
    "",
    "On the day set for oral argument, the United States attorney sent along ‚Äúthe Most Junior Junior Assistant‚Äù with instructions to say 10 very precise words, and no more.",
    "",
    "The clerk called the case. The plaintiff, representing herself, got up to make her argument. She rambled incoherently as the three-judge panel sat impassively.",
    "",
    "ADVERTISEMENT",
    "",
    "Continue reading the main story",
    "",
    "When her allotted 15 minutes had elapsed, the plaintiff returned to her seat. Judge Lumbard, who was presiding, turned to the Most Junior Junior Assistant United States attorney and invited him to respond.",
    "",
    "The Most Junior Junior Assistant stepped to the lectern. With great confidence, the young man recited the 10 very precise words he had been instructed to say:",
    "",
    "‚ÄúMay it please the court, we rest on our brief.‚Äù",
    "",
    "With that, the Most Junior Junior Assistant sat down. He had done his job, and although he had uttered only 10 words, he could put on his r√©sum√© that he had argued a case before the United States Court of Appeals.",
    "",
    "And what had his argument been? In the grandiloquent language of the law, the Most Junior Junior Assistant had stated that the appellant‚Äôs case was so utterly frivolous, so completely lacking in merit, that there was no need for the appellee to respond. To rest on one‚Äôs brief is tantamount to a wink and a nod: We all know you‚Äôre going to rule our way, so why bother to pretend?",
    "",
    "Almost always, the party resting on its brief is allowed by the court to do so.",
    "",
    "But not this time.",
    "",
    "Lumbard glowered. He got to his feet, unheard of from a judge in the middle of argument. Lumbard was not a physically towering man, but when he stood on the raised dais and glared down at the Most Junior Junior Assistant, he seemed 10 feet tall. His voice thundered:",
    "",
    "‚ÄúAre you trying to tell me, young man, that after this woman, in the exercise of her fundamental constitutional right to petition her government for the redress of grievances, has come into this courtroom to argue her case, her own government will not even do her the dignity of a response? Get up here and argue, sir!‚Äù",
    "",
    "And so the Most Junior Junior Assistant returned to the lectern and after a bit of fumbling began, nervously, to repeat what the government had argued in its brief. After a few minutes, Judge Lumbard told the young man that he could sit.",
    "",
    "A couple of weeks later, the court dismissed the appeal without comment, leaving mysterious the reason the case had been placed on the calendar. But that wasn‚Äôt the end of the story. Here‚Äôs the kicker:",
    "",
    "The woman never filed another lawsuit.",
    "",
    "Marshall had a simple explanation: She was satisfied. She had been heard, and she had seen the chief judge of the Court of Appeals yell at the government‚Äôs lawyer on her behalf. She felt vindicated.",
    "",
    "You might say: Oh, well, it was all just symbolic. After all, she lost the case.",
    "",
    "That objection misses the point Marshall was trying to make. At one level, the story is a cautionary tale about access to the courts. Few rights, years of litigation had taught him, are more precious. Southern judges and legislators sought constantly for ways to toss out the N.A.A.C.P.‚Äôs lawsuits ‚Äî or keep them from being filed. Not until 1963, after Marshall was appointed a federal appellate judge, did the Supreme Court strike down a particularly devious Virginia statute that manipulated the definition of improper solicitation to make it nearly impossible for civil rights lawyers to line up clients.",
    "",
    "ADVERTISEMENT",
    "",
    "Continue reading the main story",
    "",
    "Unsurprisingly, Marshall‚Äôs own opinions reflected a broad approach to the issue of access. In Bounds v. Smith (1977), Marshall wrote for a 6-3 Supreme Court majority that the ‚Äúfundamental constitutional right of access to the courts‚Äù requires not only that prison inmates ‚Äúbe provided at state expense with paper and pen to draft legal documents, with notarial services to authenticate them, and with stamps to mail them,‚Äù but that penitentiaries also provide either ‚Äúadequate law libraries‚Äù or free legal assistance.",
    "",
    "Still, the Judge could be a stickler over filing deadlines and other arcane procedural rules. He would remind us of the hoops the Jim Crow judges made him and the other N.A.A.C.P. lawyers jump through. He figured that the least today‚Äôs lawyers could do, facing far less onerous challenges, was get their papers to court on time.",
    "",
    "At another level, the story about Lumbard is a cautionary tale about the importance, in a democracy, of being heard. In particular, those who govern must always be prepared to listen, even to the views of those so different they seem crazy.",
    "",
    "Now and then, the Judge liked to say, the crazy people are right.",
    "",
    "Not that Marshall was ever supposed to be on the Court of Appeals, any more than he was ever supposed to be a justice of the United States Supreme Court. Jim Crow‚Äôs protectors did everything in their power to keep both prizes from his grasp. To this day, the 1967 battle over Marshall‚Äôs confirmation to the Supreme Court remains one of the two most vicious in our history ‚Äî the other being the 1916 fight over the nomination of Louis Brandeis, in which the opposition to the first Jewish justice included seven former heads of the American Bar Association, the president of Harvard and former U.S. Attorney General George Wickersham, who described Brandeis‚Äôs supporters as a ‚Äúbunch of Hebrew uplifters.‚Äù But because there was no television ‚Äî cameras were not introduced until 1987 ‚Äî we engage in collective forgetting.",
    "",
    "I‚Äôve written elsewhere in detail about what happened when Marshall was nominated. Here, let it suffice to say that part of the opposition was aimed at proving that he was a Communist sympathizer or at least a dupe with questionable connections. Another part was intended to show, in the words of one senator, the Mississippi Democrat James Eastland, that the nominee was ‚Äúprejudiced against white people in the South.‚Äù But the largest chunk was aimed ‚Äî predictably ‚Äî at proving that the first Black nominee was ... not smart enough. Never mind that he graduated first in his class at Howard University School of Law. Never mind his remarkable record as an advocate. (Marshall won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.) He was Black, so by definition he could not possibly be up to the job. That Marshall‚Äôs hearings weren‚Äôt televised was a blessing, because had this nonsense been broadcast to the nation, goodness knows how the vote would have come out.",

    "He‚Äôd remind us that he was the only justice who‚Äôd ever been in handcuffs.",

    "",
    "Of course, the opposition, led by Southern Democrats, worried most about how he would vote as a justice. Back then, the liberal position in our politics was that such inquiries were beyond the purview of the Senate. Fred Graham, writing in The Times, argued that because there existed widespread agreement that it was ‚Äúimproper‚Äù to discuss ‚Äúthe nominee‚Äôs ideological position on current issues,‚Äù the hearings tended ‚Äúto degenerate into exercises in political flapdoodle that detract from the dignity of both the Senate and the nominee.‚Äù",
    "",
    "Marshall agreed. At his confirmation hearings, when pressed by opponents on controversial Supreme Court decisions, he took refuge repeatedly in the principle that he should not discuss cases that might come before him. This was no confirmation conversion. Marshall adopted this view long before there existed the remotest prospect that he himself would one day sit on the court. In 1937, he joined the N.A.A.C.P. in supporting the confirmation of Hugo Black, when some people worried that his former opposition to anti-lynching legislation ‚Äî or more important, his rumored Ku Klux Klan membership ‚Äî would lead him to vote against civil rights plaintiffs. (It didn‚Äôt.) In 1949, as the left geared up for an all-out effort to prevent the appointment of Tom Clark, who as attorney general maintained the government‚Äôs list of dangerous subversives, Marshall dissented. (Marshall could scarcely have imagined that 18 years later, he himself would be Clark‚Äôs successor.) In our conversations, the Judge never wavered from the view that the likely votes of a potential justice were none of the Senate‚Äôs business.",
    "",
    "Which is not to say that Marshall himself didn‚Äôt care. At the time we began the oral-history interviews in 1992, the hearings on Clarence Thomas‚Äôs nomination to succeed him had recently concluded. Most of what the Judge had to say about Thomas was off the record. Still, it‚Äôs hardly news that he would have preferred a successor with views somewhat closer to his own. But there was one point he emphasized repeatedly, harking back, perhaps, to his own bitter experience:",
    "",
    "Grilling the nominee about potential votes was a terrible idea.",
    "",
    "A racist image of Marshall as lazy and disengaged lingers, fed perhaps by his cartoonish portrayal in ‚ÄúThe Brethren,‚Äù a behind-the-scenes account of the Supreme Court by the journalists Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong that was published the year before I began my clerkship. The Marshall of the book rarely gave the cases before him much thought and was more interested in soap operas than the work of the court. The Judge was wounded, but not because most of what the book had to say about him was absurd. His skin had always been thick. He had endured far worse ‚Äî and not only from the Dixiecrats who fought viciously but unsuccessfully to keep him off the Supreme Court.",
    "",
    "In 1961, for example, when President Kennedy nominated him to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the American Bar Association declined to give him its highest rating. Marshall shrugged off the predictable insult from an organization that just 11 years earlier refused to admit Black members. During his nearly four years on the appellate bench, he wrote 112 majority opinions without a single reversal.",
    "",
    "But insults weren‚Äôt the worst of it. The first major civil rights case he ever tried, against the University of Maryland‚Äôs lily-white law school, prompted death threats. He pressed on and won. (The color bar had been firmly in place when Marshall, a Baltimore native, applied to law school, and decades later he was still bitter.) During the decades he spent crisscrossing the South and Midwest, trying civil rights and criminal cases, often for little or no remuneration, menacing letters and phone calls became commonplace.",
    "",
    "The intimidation was more than mere background noise. On a dark Tennessee night in November 1946, Marshall came within mere minutes of being lynched. (More on that in a moment.) Years later, during his confirmation hearings for the Court of Appeals, he would face angry grilling over his public suggestion that the Ku Klux Klan was in league with the devil. He didn‚Äôt back down.",

    "So although the Judge was surely bothered by his portrayal in ‚ÄúThe Brethren,‚Äù he was ultimately too experienced and tough to be annoyed by a handful of stereotypes. His pain stemmed rather from a sense of betrayal. His chambers were warm, and he treated his clerks like family. Over the years, he took us into his confidence. At his home in Virginia, his wife served us marvelous dinners. The Judge himself beat us soundly at pool. The secrecy of the internal work of the chambers was a sacred trust. Marshall always believed in keeping his word. The clerks whom he suspected of speaking to the reporters had broken theirs. (I refused to speak or write publicly about the Judge until the mid-1980s, when he gave me explicit permission.)",

    "",
    "About that near-lynching. The story has been told so often that it‚Äôs easy to forget why Marshall repeated it. Short version: Marshall and two other lawyers were in Columbia, Tenn., to try the case of two Black men who in self-defense had fired on a mob of white hooligans. As they left the city with the Judge at the wheel, the police pulled them over. Marshall was arrested and charged with drunken driving. They put him in the back seat of a police car. On each side was a deputy, gun drawn. The car took the turnoff for Duck River, where many a Black corpse had been hidden. Reliving that night, Marshall was solemn. He thought his time had come. He learned later that a white mob was indeed waiting for him at Duck River.",
    "",
    "What saved his life was that the other lawyers, in a remarkable show of bravery, followed the police. Realizing that there was no way to spirit Marshall secretly to the end planned for him, the officers gave up and returned to the highway. Back in Columbia, he was hauled before a justice of the peace. (Sometimes Marshall said magistrate; other times, judge.)",
    "",
    "At this point in the story, Marshall‚Äôs eyes would glow once more with their usual delight. The justice of the peace said Marshall would go free if he could pass one little test. The justice, a teetotaler, declared that he could smell alcohol miles away. He invited Marshall to breathe in his face ‚Äî and immediately found him not guilty.",
    "",
    "Marshall would laugh and laugh when he told this story. But for once the rest of us didn‚Äôt laugh along. We had thought we understood the struggle to which the Judge had devoted his life. By bringing the shadow of death into the room, he had reminded us all of the stakes.",
    "",
    "And whenever the Supreme Court heard a case involving the rights of criminal suspects, he‚Äôd remind us that he was the only Justice who‚Äôd ever been in handcuffs ‚Äî or sat on the wrong side of an interrogation table.",
    "",
    "Another story, in its own way equally horrifying, was set in the 1940s, inside a pool hall somewhere in the Deep South. Marshall sat at a table, drinking with friends, when a Black man he didn‚Äôt know approached and, hesitant, asked for a word. Marshall invited him to sit, but the man preferred to stand.",

    "",
    "When the Judge told that story, he never laughed. Instead, he grew introspective ‚Äî and would, for once, explain himself. To Marshall, the tale illustrated what the struggle was really about. School desegregation or employment equality or voting rights, all were important, but none were ends in themselves. They were goals in the service of creating a world in which Black people would no longer see themselves the way the stranger in the pool hall did.",
    "",
    "Yet despite the insults, despite the threats, despite the risks to his own life, the Judge found in his heart little room for hatred. Many of his tales involved what he called ‚Äúplaying cards and drinking whiskey.‚Äù And who were his card-playing, whiskey-drinking partners? Usually his friends and colleagues, but now and then ‚Äî to hear the Judge tell it ‚Äî they were some of the most notorious segregationists of the era. Marshall would sit with them in back rooms across the South, making deals.",
    "",
    "Marshall particularly liked to tell the story of playing cards one night with a notorious segregationist governor. Marshall reminded the governor that no Black nurses were employed at any of the state hospitals ‚Äî including the colored hospital. If nothing changed, there would probably be a lawsuit.",

    "A few days later, the trustees of the state hospital system met. The governor, an ex officio member, put in a rare appearance.

    "Offensive, to be sure, but that made no difference to Marshall. Although I‚Äôve long wondered whether the story might be apocryphal, it illustrates his central ethic. Marshall‚Äôs goal was to get things done. ‚ÄúYou could do business with him‚Äù ‚Äî that was his highest praise.",

    "Consider Davis. He believed passionately in the cause of ‚Äústates‚Äô rights‚Äù and had an ardent faith in a Constitution interpreted according to the original understanding. But his politics didn‚Äôt always lean toward the right. He denounced the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s when the group was powerful in the Democratic Party. He had represented West Virginia coal miners who were prosecuted for little more than protesting in violation of a court order. Right around the time of the Brown decision, during the most oppressive years of the McCarthy era, Davis worked with the estimable Lloyd Garrison to fight the order stripping the physicist Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, of his security clearance, because of supposed Communist sympathies.",

    "I often hear people dismiss Marshall‚Äôs warmth toward his opponents as merely a ‚Äútactic‚Äù ‚Äî the necessary if uncomfortable move of the era. No doubt his attitude contained an element of that. But to treat Thurgood Marshall‚Äôs gregarious humanity, his ability to see past differences, as a notable act of insincerity, a kind of minstrel show in the service of the freedom struggle, is to peer at one of the towering figures of history through the same distorting lens that accounts for the smallness of today‚Äôs political vision. I spent enough time with the Judge to be certain that his warmth toward his opponents was genuine, characteristic of a man who so delighted in his fellow human beings that it was difficult to earn his enmity. That our commonalities are greater than our differences is a clich√©, but Marshall believed it to his core.",

    "His belief in America was strong, and his distaste for communism equally so. Nevertheless, he opposed punishment for the blacklisted screenwriters, directors and producers known as the Hollywood 10, a choice that could have cost him dearly in 1967, when opponents of his nomination to the Supreme Court used his support for the constitutional rights of those whose views he disliked as evidence of his radical sympathies. But for Marshall free speech was a near absolute, a right to be enjoyed by those whose ideas were most pernicious.",
    "",
    "The Judge never believed in measuring speech by its potential for danger. In 1969, the radical Belgian economist Ernest Mandel was invited to speak at Stanford University. Mandel was an unapologetic Marxist, and the Nixon administration denied him an entry visa. When a majority of the Supreme Court declined to intervene, Marshall authored a thundery dissent: ‚ÄúAmericans cannot be denied the opportunity to hear Dr. Mandel‚Äôs views in person because their government disapproves of his ideas.‚Äù",

    "That isn‚Äôt to say that Marshall was uncritical, even of theoretical allies. He was angry about President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs decision to postpone introducing civil rights legislation to avoid harming the rest of his agenda and would later question his dedication to the cause of equality. He had his differences with Lyndon Johnson as well but gave him credit for pressing forward with the civil rights laws, even with the knowledge that it would most likely end his political career. Johnson was also the kind of hard-drinking, storytelling back-room bargainer Marshall liked.",

Particularly rankling was the fact that Malcolm had on one occasion given an angry crowd Marshall‚Äôs home address.",

    "Even the mass protest wing of the civil rights movement, nowadays celebrated as its linchpin, met with Marshall‚Äôs skepticism. Years later, he continued to wonder aloud how he was supposed to keep insisting that the segregationists had no choice but to comply with the edicts of the courts when those on his side claimed the right to disobey laws they considered unjust. For Marshall, law possessed a talismanic quality, representing all that was best in American democracy.",
    "",
    "Yet the Judge was hardly blind to the imperfections of the legal system. In a much-quoted 1981 dissent, he condemned the ‚Äúsimplistic penological philosophy that, if we lock the prison doors and throw away the keys, our streets will somehow be safe.‚Äù In a 1978 speech at Howard University, he criticized American apologists who were fond of pointing out that South Africa treated Black people worse: ‚ÄúSo what! We are not in South Africa. We are here.‚Äù Still, he considered law the crucial tool for the betterment of society, a lifelong credo perhaps best expressed in a 1968 address in Chicago. ‚ÄúThe changes which are to be won must be won,‚Äù he told the audience, ‚Äúbut they must be achieved through law.‚Äù As for those who considered legal change too slow, Marshall politely disagreed: ‚ÄúThe law is not always the fastest or the shortest road to justice, but we must take it nevertheless.‚Äù",
    "",
    "His faith in human reasonableness was nearly as great, and at times it could make him sound na√Øve. In 1956, he told The New Yorker that he could not imagine that widespread resistance to integration would continue in the face of court orders, a prospect he labeled ‚Äúthe end of the country.‚Äù A year later, as Jim Crow‚Äôs battle for survival grew more turbulent, he did a television interview with Mike Wallace. A few minutes into the video, Wallace poses this question: ‚ÄúDo you feel any sympathy for, any understanding of the Southerner, the white Southerner who is forced suddenly to change not only his attitude but his whole way of life?‚Äù",

It‚Äôs a problem that at times would seem to the average Southern white man as being insoluble.

And it was his ability to find that human connection, to reach out across the greatest moral divide of the 20th century, that enabled the Judge to accomplish so much while maintaining his fundamental dignity and decency. Without that quality, he would have been just another lawyer.",
    "",
    "When Marshall was offered advice he didn‚Äôt like, he often responded with a brisk witticism: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only three things I have to do: stay black, pay taxes and die.‚Äù He was only half-joking. If there was one thing the Judge hated, it was being told what to do. He always went his own way.",
    "",
    "An example: When I went to work for him in the summer of 1980, the Judge was still using ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù to refer to the race. He hated the term ‚Äúblack‚Äù ‚Äî back then spelled with a lowercase B ‚Äî which had often been an opprobrious way of talking about the people to whose fight for equality he‚Äôd devoted his life. Whenever anyone raised the question (and for the most part nobody dared), he would answer that he‚Äôd spent his life fighting for the capital N in ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt going to let ‚Äúa bunch of kids‚Äù (sometimes put more strongly) tell him what he should call himself.",
    "",
    "Today we scarcely recall the titanic struggle over capitalizing ‚ÄúNegro.‚Äù The New York Times, for instance, didn‚Äôt make the change until 1930, when Marshall was already in his 20s. A number of newspapers waited until after Brown was decided.",
    "",
    "A couple of years before his retirement, the Judge switched to ‚ÄúAfro-American,‚Äù but he never seemed comfortable with the term. Across the many hours we spent together during the final year of his life, ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù remained his descriptor of choice. He‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt consider the word an insult. As for always going his own way ‚Äî he helped teach me that too, even though our mutual devotion to intellectual independence now and then led us into disagreement.",
    "",
    "Not that he could always go his own way. Jim Crow prevented it. That was the point of another favorite Marshall story. This one was set in various places ‚Äî once Mississippi, another time South Carolina, yet another Oklahoma ‚Äî and involved the time Marshall was trying a case in a small, segregated town. He was standing at the train station ‚Äî or was it the bus station? ‚Äî when a sheriff‚Äôs deputy approached. ‚ÄúSon,‚Äù the deputy said ‚Äî or was it ‚ÄúBoy‚Äù? ‚Äî anyway, the rest of the tale is what matters: ‚ÄúThe sun has never set on a live nigger in this town.‚Äù At that point, with his audience sick with disgust and full of dread, the Judge would laugh: ‚ÄúSo I tucked my constitutional rights in my pocket and got the hell out of Dodge!‚Äù",
    "",
    "You have to pick your moments, he was saying. Or at least, in the places he tried cases, he had to. That was why he was careful not to defy local segregation laws: He was in town, he used to say, not on his own behalf but on behalf of his clients.

Greene (1981), in which the majority refused to disturb the city‚Äôs decision to build a barrier that kept Black traffic from traversing an all-white neighborhood. Reading Marshall‚Äôs dissent, you can hardly miss the echoes of that deputy who told him to get out of town before sunrise: A ‚Äúgroup of white citizens has decided to act to keep Negro citizens from traveling through their urban ‚Äòutopia,‚Äô and the city has placed its seal of approval on the scheme.‚Äù",
    "",
    "The Judge always had a felicitous turn of the simplest phrase, what I thought of as the pinpricks, the sharp little barbs that made big points: like the November 1981 oral argument in a death-penalty case, when Justice William Rehnquist asked why taxpayers should have to foot the bill for what the petitioner preferred, a life sentence together with psychiatric care. Marshall, who rarely spoke in the courtroom, leaned toward his microphone and intoned, ‚ÄúWell, it would be cheaper just to shoot him when you arrested him, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù The unusually sharp exchange made the news. (Marshall‚Äôs side prevailed.)",

    "Or the time a clerk sent a memorandum to let the Judge know that an appeal had been filed in a case raising an issue dear to his heart. We assumed he‚Äôd want the court to hear the argument. The memo advised that he ‚ÄúJoin 3‚Äù ‚Äî meaning, provide the required fourth vote to hear the appeal if three other justices were interested. The note was returned with the words ‚ÄúJoin 8!‚Äù in red, heavily underlined ‚Äî signifying that Marshall wanted the Supreme Court nowhere near the issue until he had a lot more than four votes on his side.",

We‚Äôll never know the names of people who walk through doors we ourselves had to kick and shove to get through ‚Äî sometimes while getting our hands dirty.

    "The year I spent clerking for the Judge coincided with the late-20th-century revolution of the right, when Ronald Reagan swept into the White House in a landslide that brought along, for the first time in decades, a Senate controlled entirely by Republicans. The nation was stunned, but the business of the court continued. On the morning after the election, the justices were scheduled to sit.

    "",
    "Marshall argued the case, and the justices unanimously took his side. ‚ÄúThe constitutional rights of respondents,‚Äù wrote the court, ‚Äúare not to be sacrificed or yielded to the violence and disorder which have followed upon the actions of the Governor and Legislature.‚Äù Black people ‚Äî or Negroes, as he would have said ‚Äî were jubilant. After the decision was announced, Marshall climbed into a taxicab in New York, heading to a celebration. The Black driver had no idea who his passenger was, but seeing a well-dressed man of his own race, he asked if he‚Äôd heard about the verdict.",

    "",
    "Marshall would chuckle as he recited the punchline. He wasn‚Äôt complaining. Even back in the 1950s, he‚Äôd had several lifetimes worth of recognition. But like all his stories, this one was intended to make a point: It was a reminder of how, in the popular image of the civil rights movement, protests are everything, and the law is a sideshow.",

    "And he was indeed a reliable vote for broad, liberal interpretations of the Constitution on issues ranging from racial justice to abortion rights. Early in his tenure, he helped establish the modern understanding of the right to privacy, authoring the court‚Äôs unanimous 1969 opinion in Stanley v. Georgia, which upheld the freedom to possess pornographic materials for private use, a decision celebrated at the time, with a certain sexist nostalgia, as the ‚Äúman‚Äôs home is his castle‚Äù case.

On later visits to the court, I would sit in his sunny, capacious office, eager to hear more. And during the last year of his life, the two of us spent a great deal of time together in the smaller upstairs chambers assigned to him upon his retirement, because he had asked me to serve as the interviewer for his official oral history for the Federal Judicial Center. Our conversations lasted countless hours but also all too few. The recordings remain sealed, but even outside the audio taping, we talked. Or, rather, the Judge talked; I listened and learned.",

    "Marshall was among the great storytellers, heir to an American tradition stretching back to Lincoln and beyond. He told stories to teach lessons ‚Äî and also like Lincoln, he never told the same story quite the same way twice. The message was what mattered.",

    "So let‚Äôs consider some of his stories, and the lessons they taught. The first concerns a lawsuit that arose in the 1960s while Marshall was a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The plaintiff was well known in New York‚Äôs federal courts because she filed complaints regularly, the sort of complaints that claim that the government has installed electrodes in the plaintiff‚Äôs brain to steal her ideas for television shows ‚Äî things like that.",
    "",
    "Her lawsuits were always thrown out, her appeals always dismissed without a hearing. Anyone who has worked around the courts knows there‚Äôs no other way to handle a litigant in the throes of delusion.",
    "",
    "At this time, the chief judge of the circuit was J. Edward Lumbard. As Marshall told the story, Lumbard, without a word to anyone else, put the woman‚Äôs appeal on the calendar for oral argument. Nothing like this had happened before. Nobody could figure out what was going on.",
    "",
    "On the day set for oral argument, the United States attorney sent along ‚Äúthe Most Junior Junior Assistant‚Äù with instructions to say 10 very precise words, and no more.",
    "",
    "The clerk called the case. The plaintiff, representing herself, got up to make her argument. She rambled incoherently as the three-judge panel sat impassively.",

    "Continue reading the main story",
    "",
    "When her allotted 15 minutes had elapsed, the plaintiff returned to her seat. Judge Lumbard, who was presiding, turned to the Most Junior Junior Assistant United States attorney and invited him to respond.",
    "",
    "The Most Junior Junior Assistant stepped to the lectern. With great confidence, the young man recited the 10 very precise words he had been instructed to say:",
    "",
    "‚ÄúMay it please the court, we rest on our brief.‚Äù",
    "",
    "With that, the Most Junior Junior Assistant sat down. He had done his job, and although he had uttered only 10 words, he could put on his r√©sum√© that he had argued a case before the United States Court of Appeals.",
    "",
    "And what had his argument been? In the grandiloquent language of the law, the Most Junior Junior Assistant had stated that the appellant‚Äôs case was so utterly frivolous, so completely lacking in merit, that there was no need for the appellee to respond. To rest on one‚Äôs brief is tantamount to a wink and a nod: We all know you‚Äôre going to rule our way, so why bother to pretend?",
    "",
    "Almost always, the party resting on its brief is allowed by the court to do so.",
    "",
    "But not this time.",
    "",
    "Lumbard glowered. He got to his feet, unheard of from a judge in the middle of argument. Lumbard was not a physically towering man, but when he stood on the raised dais and glared down at the Most Junior Junior Assistant, he seemed 10 feet tall. His voice thundered:",
    "",
    "‚ÄúAre you trying to tell me, young man, that after this woman, in the exercise of her fundamental constitutional right to petition her government for the redress of grievances, has come into this courtroom to argue her case, her own government will not even do her the dignity of a response? Get up here and argue, sir!‚Äù",
    "",
    "And so the Most Junior Junior Assistant returned to the lectern and after a bit of fumbling began, nervously, to repeat what the government had argued in its brief. After a few minutes, Judge Lumbard told the young man that he could sit.",
    "",
    "A couple of weeks later, the court dismissed the appeal without comment, leaving mysterious the reason the case had been placed on the calendar. But that wasn‚Äôt the end of the story. Here‚Äôs the kicker:",
    "",
    "The woman never filed another lawsuit.",
    "",
    "Marshall had a simple explanation: She was satisfied. She had been heard, and she had seen the chief judge of the Court of Appeals yell at the government‚Äôs lawyer on her behalf. She felt vindicated.",
    "",
    "You might say: Oh, well, it was all just symbolic. After all, she lost the case.",
    "",
    "That objection misses the point Marshall was trying to make. At one level, the story is a cautionary tale about access to the courts. Few rights, years of litigation had taught him, are more precious. Southern judges and legislators sought constantly for ways to toss out the N.A.A.C.P.‚Äôs lawsuits ‚Äî or keep them from being filed. Not until 1963, after Marshall was appointed a federal appellate judge, did the Supreme Court strike down a particularly devious Virginia statute that manipulated the definition of improper solicitation to make it nearly impossible for civil rights lawyers to line up clients.",

    "Unsurprisingly, Marshall‚Äôs own opinions reflected a broad approach to the issue of access. In Bounds v. Smith (1977), Marshall wrote for a 6-3 Supreme Court majority that the ‚Äúfundamental constitutional right of access to the courts‚Äù requires not only that prison inmates ‚Äúbe provided at state expense with paper and pen to draft legal documents, with notarial services to authenticate them, and with stamps to mail them,‚Äù but that penitentiaries also provide either ‚Äúadequate law libraries‚Äù or free legal assistance.",
    "",
    "Still, the Judge could be a stickler over filing deadlines and other arcane procedural rules. He would remind us of the hoops the Jim Crow judges made him and the other N.A.A.C.P. lawyers jump through. He figured that the least today‚Äôs lawyers could do, facing far less onerous challenges, was get their papers to court on time.",
    "",
    "At another level, the story about Lumbard is a cautionary tale about the importance, in a democracy, of being heard. In particular, those who govern must always be prepared to listen, even to the views of those so different they seem crazy.",
    "",
    "Now and then, the Judge liked to say, the crazy people are right.",

    "Not that Marshall was ever supposed to be on the Court of Appeals, any more than he was ever supposed to be a justice of the United States Supreme Court. Jim Crow‚Äôs protectors did everything in their power to keep both prizes from his grasp. To this day, the 1967 battle over Marshall‚Äôs confirmation to the Supreme Court remains one of the two most vicious in our history ‚Äî the other being the 1916 fight over the nomination of Louis Brandeis, in which the opposition to the first Jewish justice included seven former heads of the American Bar Association, the president of Harvard and former U.S. Attorney General George Wickersham, who described Brandeis‚Äôs supporters as a ‚Äúbunch of Hebrew uplifters.‚Äù But because there was no television ‚Äî cameras were not introduced until 1987 ‚Äî we engage in collective forgetting.",

    "I‚Äôve written elsewhere in detail about what happened when Marshall was nominated. Here, let it suffice to say that part of the opposition was aimed at proving that he was a Communist sympathizer or at least a dupe with questionable connections. Another part was intended to show, in the words of one senator, the Mississippi Democrat James Eastland, that the nominee was ‚Äúprejudiced against white people in the South.‚Äù But the largest chunk was aimed ‚Äî predictably ‚Äî at proving that the first Black nominee was ... not smart enough. Never mind that he graduated first in his class at Howard University School of Law. Never mind his remarkable record as an advocate. (Marshall won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court.) He was Black, so by definition he could not possibly be up to the job. That Marshall‚Äôs hearings weren‚Äôt televised was a blessing, because had this nonsense been broadcast to the nation, goodness knows how the vote would have come out.",

    "Of course, the opposition, led by Southern Democrats, worried most about how he would vote as a justice. Back then, the liberal position in our politics was that such inquiries were beyond the purview of the Senate. Fred Graham, writing in The Times, argued that because there existed widespread agreement that it was ‚Äúimproper‚Äù to discuss ‚Äúthe nominee‚Äôs ideological position on current issues,‚Äù the hearings tended ‚Äúto degenerate into exercises in political flapdoodle that detract from the dignity of both the Senate and the nominee.‚Äù",
    "",
    "Marshall agreed. At his confirmation hearings, when pressed by opponents on controversial Supreme Court decisions, he took refuge repeatedly in the principle that he should not discuss cases that might come before him. This was no confirmation conversion. Marshall adopted this view long before there existed the remotest prospect that he himself would one day sit on the court. In 1937, he joined the N.A.A.C.P. in supporting the confirmation of Hugo Black, when some people worried that his former opposition to anti-lynching legislation ‚Äî or more important, his rumored Ku Klux Klan membership ‚Äî would lead him to vote against civil rights plaintiffs. (It didn‚Äôt.) In 1949, as the left geared up for an all-out effort to prevent the appointment of Tom Clark, who as attorney general maintained the government‚Äôs list of dangerous subversives, Marshall dissented. (Marshall could scarcely have imagined that 18 years later, he himself would be Clark‚Äôs successor.) In our conversations, the Judge never wavered from the view that the likely votes of a potential justice were none of the Senate‚Äôs business.",
    "",
    "Which is not to say that Marshall himself didn‚Äôt care. At the time we began the oral-history interviews in 1992, the hearings on Clarence Thomas‚Äôs nomination to succeed him had recently concluded. Most of what the Judge had to say about Thomas was off the record. Still, it‚Äôs hardly news that he would have preferred a successor with views somewhat closer to his own. But there was one point he emphasized repeatedly, harking back, perhaps, to his own bitter experience:",
    "",
    "Grilling the nominee about potential votes was a terrible idea.",
    "",
    "A racist image of Marshall as lazy and disengaged lingers, fed perhaps by his cartoonish portrayal in ‚ÄúThe Brethren,‚Äù a behind-the-scenes account of the Supreme Court by the journalists Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong that was published the year before I began my clerkship. The Marshall of the book rarely gave the cases before him much thought and was more interested in soap operas than the work of the court. The Judge was wounded, but not because most of what the book had to say about him was absurd. His skin had always been thick. He had endured far worse ‚Äî and not only from the Dixiecrats who fought viciously but unsuccessfully to keep him off the Supreme Court.",
    "",
    "In 1961, for example, when President Kennedy nominated him to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the American Bar Association declined to give him its highest rating. Marshall shrugged off the predictable insult from an organization that just 11 years earlier refused to admit Black members. During his nearly four years on the appellate bench, he wrote 112 majority opinions without a single reversal.",
    "",
    "But insults weren‚Äôt the worst of it. The first major civil rights case he ever tried, against the University of Maryland‚Äôs lily-white law school, prompted death threats. He pressed on and won. (The color bar had been firmly in place when Marshall, a Baltimore native, applied to law school, and decades later he was still bitter.) During the decades he spent crisscrossing the South and Midwest, trying civil rights and criminal cases, often for little or no remuneration, menacing letters and phone calls became commonplace.",
    "",
    "The intimidation was more than mere background noise. On a dark Tennessee night in November 1946, Marshall came within mere minutes of being lynched. (More on that in a moment.) Years later, during his confirmation hearings for the Court of Appeals, he would face angry grilling over his public suggestion that the Ku Klux Klan was in league with the devil.

    "So although the Judge was surely bothered by his portrayal in ‚ÄúThe Brethren,‚Äù he was ultimately too experienced and tough to be annoyed by a handful of stereotypes. His pain stemmed rather from a sense of betrayal. His chambers were warm, and he treated his clerks like family. Over the years, he took us into his confidence. At his home in Virginia, his wife served us marvelous dinners. The Judge himself beat us soundly at pool. The secrecy of the internal work of the chambers was a sacred trust. Marshall always believed in keeping his word. The clerks whom he suspected of speaking to the reporters had broken theirs.

    "About that near-lynching. The story has been told so often that it‚Äôs easy to forget why Marshall repeated it. Short version: Marshall and two other lawyers were in Columbia, Tenn., to try the case of two Black men who in self-defense had fired on a mob of white hooligans. As they left the city with the Judge at the wheel, the police pulled them over. Marshall was arrested and charged with drunken driving. They put him in the back seat of a police car. On each side was a deputy, gun drawn. The car took the turnoff for Duck River, where many a Black corpse had been hidden. Reliving that night, Marshall was solemn. He thought his time had come. He learned later that a white mob was indeed waiting for him at Duck River.",
    "",
    "What saved his life was that the other lawyers, in a remarkable show of bravery, followed the police. Realizing that there was no way to spirit Marshall secretly to the end planned for him, the officers gave up and returned to the highway. Back in Columbia, he was hauled before a justice of the peace. (Sometimes Marshall said magistrate; other times, judge.)",
    "",
    "At this point in the story, Marshall‚Äôs eyes would glow once more with their usual delight. The justice of the peace said Marshall would go free if he could pass one little test. The justice, a teetotaler, declared that he could smell alcohol miles away. He invited Marshall to breathe in his face ‚Äî and immediately found him not guilty.",
    "",
    "Marshall would laugh and laugh when he told this story. But for once the rest of us didn‚Äôt laugh along. We had thought we understood the struggle to which the Judge had devoted his life. By bringing the shadow of death into the room, he had reminded us all of the stakes.",

    "Another story, in its own way equally horrifying, was set in the 1940s, inside a pool hall somewhere in the Deep South.

I spent enough time with the Judge to be certain that his warmth toward his opponents was genuine, characteristic of a man who so delighted in his fellow human beings that it was difficult to earn his enmity.

We are here.‚Äù Still, he considered law the crucial tool for the betterment of society, a lifelong credo perhaps best expressed in a 1968 address in Chicago. ‚ÄúThe changes which are to be won must be won,‚Äù he told the audience, ‚Äúbut they must be achieved through law.‚Äù As for those who considered legal change too slow, Marshall politely disagreed: ‚ÄúThe law is not always the fastest or the shortest road to justice, but we must take it nevertheless.‚Äù",
    "",
    "His faith in human reasonableness was nearly as great, and at times it could make him sound na√Øve. In 1956, he told The New Yorker that he could not imagine that widespread resistance to integration would continue in the face of court orders, a prospect he labeled ‚Äúthe end of the country.‚Äù A year later, as Jim Crow‚Äôs battle for survival grew more turbulent, he did a television interview with Mike Wallace. A few minutes into the video, Wallace poses this question: ‚ÄúDo you feel any sympathy for, any understanding of the Southerner, the white Southerner who is forced suddenly to change not only his attitude but his whole way of life?‚Äù",
    "",
    "Marshall was being invited, on national television, to condemn those who had fought the equality of his people over every tiny inch of ground. But he sat calmly, then offered this reply: ‚ÄúI have as much sympathy as I could have for anybody. I recognize it is a tough problem. It‚Äôs a problem that at times would seem to the average Southern white man as being insoluble. I recognize it, and I for one would do everything in my power ‚Äî so would the N.A.A.C.P. ‚Äî to work it out in a way that would be satisfactory to both sides‚Äô concerns.‚Äù",

    "But this wasn‚Äôt na√Øvet√©. It was a mark of the genuine grace with which he viewed other people. And it was his ability to find that human connection, to reach out across the greatest moral divide of the 20th century, that enabled the Judge to accomplish so much while maintaining his fundamental dignity and decency. Without that quality, he would have been just another lawyer.",
    "",
    "When Marshall was offered advice he didn‚Äôt like, he often responded with a brisk witticism: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only three things I have to do: stay black, pay taxes and die.‚Äù He was only half-joking. If there was one thing the Judge hated, it was being told what to do. He always went his own way.",
    "",
    "An example: When I went to work for him in the summer of 1980, the Judge was still using ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù to refer to the race. He hated the term ‚Äúblack‚Äù ‚Äî back then spelled with a lowercase B ‚Äî which had often been an opprobrious way of talking about the people to whose fight for equality he‚Äôd devoted his life. Whenever anyone raised the question (and for the most part nobody dared), he would answer that he‚Äôd spent his life fighting for the capital N in ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt going to let ‚Äúa bunch of kids‚Äù (sometimes put more strongly) tell him what he should call himself.",
    "",
    "Today we scarcely recall the titanic struggle over capitalizing ‚ÄúNegro.‚Äù The New York Times, for instance, didn‚Äôt make the change until 1930, when Marshall was already in his 20s. A number of newspapers waited until after Brown was decided.",
    "",
    "A couple of years before his retirement, the Judge switched to ‚ÄúAfro-American,‚Äù but he never seemed comfortable with the term. Across the many hours we spent together during the final year of his life, ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù remained his descriptor of choice. He‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt consider the word an insult. As for always going his own way ‚Äî he helped teach me that too, even though our mutual devotion to intellectual independence now and then led us into disagreement.",
    "",
    "Not that he could always go his own way. Jim Crow prevented it. That was the point of another favorite Marshall story. This one was set in various places ‚Äî once Mississippi, another time South Carolina, yet another Oklahoma ‚Äî and involved the time Marshall was trying a case in a small, segregated town. He was standing at the train station ‚Äî or was it the bus station? ‚Äî when a sheriff‚Äôs deputy approached. ‚ÄúSon,‚Äù the deputy said ‚Äî or was it ‚ÄúBoy‚Äù? ‚Äî anyway, the rest of the tale is what matters: ‚ÄúThe sun has never set on a live nigger in this town.‚Äù At that point, with his audience sick with disgust and full of dread, the Judge would laugh: ‚ÄúSo I tucked my constitutional rights in my pocket and got the hell out of Dodge!‚Äù",
    "",
    "You have to pick your moments, he was saying. Or at least, in the places he tried cases, he had to. That was why he was careful not to defy local segregation laws: He was in town, he used to say, not on his own behalf but on behalf of his clients. He was willing to suffer a little in the cause of alleviating their far greater suffering.",

    "But the moments he picked! Consider City of Memphis v. Greene (1981), in which the majority refused to disturb the city‚Äôs decision to build a barrier that kept Black traffic from traversing an all-white neighborhood. Reading Marshall‚Äôs dissent, you can hardly miss the echoes of that deputy who told him to get out of town before sunrise: A ‚Äúgroup of white citizens has decided to act to keep Negro citizens from traveling through their urban ‚Äòutopia,‚Äô and the city has placed its seal of approval on the scheme.‚Äù",
    "",
    "The Judge always had a felicitous turn of the simplest phrase, what I thought of as the pinpricks, the sharp little barbs that made big points: like the November 1981 oral argument in a death-penalty case, when Justice William Rehnquist asked why taxpayers should have to foot the bill for what the petitioner preferred, a life sentence together with psychiatric care. Marshall, who rarely spoke in the courtroom, leaned toward his microphone and intoned, ‚ÄúWell, it would be cheaper just to shoot him when you arrested him, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù The unusually sharp exchange made the news. (Marshall‚Äôs side prevailed.)",
    "",
    "Or the time a clerk sent a memorandum to let the Judge know that an appeal had been filed in a case raising an issue dear to his heart. We assumed he‚Äôd want the court to hear the argument. The memo advised that he ‚ÄúJoin 3‚Äù ‚Äî meaning, provide the required fourth vote to hear the appeal if three other justices were interested. The note was returned with the words ‚ÄúJoin 8!‚Äù in red, heavily underlined ‚Äî signifying that Marshall wanted the Supreme Court nowhere near the issue until he had a lot more than four votes on his side.",
    "",
    "Or the time I asked him why he was so adamant in opposition to capital punishment. ‚ÄúSame reason I‚Äôm against war,‚Äù he said, deadpan. ‚ÄúThou shalt not kill.‚Äù Then the familiar laugh: ‚ÄúI still eat meat, though.‚Äù",
    "",
    "And even the occasion of our first meeting, in the spring of 1978. I was still a law student, and Marshall came up to Yale to preside over the final round of the moot-court competition. Just before dinner, his wife, Cissy, introduced us. ‚ÄúThurgood,‚Äù she said with her beautiful smile, ‚Äúthis is Eunice Carter‚Äôs grandson.‚Äù (Eunice, my grandmother, had been a prosecutor in New York and a friend and neighbor of the Marshalls.) The Judge gave me a skeptical look. ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù he said, and stalked away.",

    "This was not, as you might suppose, an act of rudeness; at least I‚Äôve never taken it so.

    "",
    "And so he did.",
    "",
    "When our hero emerged from the restroom, he was standing on the casino floor with 25 cents to his name. So he did what anybody would do. He put the quarter in a slot machine. And it wouldn‚Äôt be a good story unless he hit the jackpot.",

    "So he did.",

    "When our hero quit 48 hours later, he had a net worth in the millions of dollars.",

    "And he swore off gambling for life.",

    "He invested the money with a brilliant broker who must have been able to see the future, because our hero‚Äôs fortune just kept multiplying. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt know what investment strategy he used. We do know that 30 years after that night at the casino, our hero had become one of the wealthiest people in the country.",

    "At that point, our hero came to a momentous decision. He called the press together and told the assembled reporters the story of how he had made his fortune, beginning with that night in Las Vegas. Then he made a public promise that if his ‚Äúbenefactor‚Äù came forward, he‚Äôd receive half of our hero‚Äôs fortune.",

    "",
    "The audience laughed and laughed, not least because the Judge, an old-fashioned spellbinder, paused or gestured at well-chosen instants. But like all Marshall‚Äôs stories, this one also made a point. We‚Äôll never know the names of all the people who fought to open doors for us. We‚Äôll never know the names of people who walk through doors we ourselves had to kick and shove to get through ‚Äî sometimes while getting our hands dirty. Our job is to keep working to open them anyway, not for thanks or glory but for the sake of doing what is right. And in the complexity and strife of America‚Äôs remarkable 20th century, no one did more to open doors for others than Thurgood Marshall.",
    "",
    "The year I spent clerking for the Judge coincided with the late-20th-century revolution of the right, when Ronald Reagan swept into the White House in a landslide that brought along, for the first time in decades, a Senate controlled entirely by Republicans. The nation was stunned, but the business of the court continued. On the morning after the election, the justices were scheduled to sit. As I left the chambers to take my seat in the curtained alcove set aside for clerks, I spotted Justice William Brennan, looking hopefully up at the Judge as if seeking deliverance from the results of the previous night.",
    "",
    "Was it really true ‚Äî a stricken Brennan asked his fellow liberal lion ‚Äî that Strom Thurmond would now be chairman of the Judiciary Committee?",
    "",
    "Thurmond, the South Carolina segregationist, had been the principal antagonist at Marshall‚Äôs confirmation hearings. And at that moment there was every reason to think that the edifice of rights the Judge had spent his life building would soon be under assault. But he made no reply to Brennan‚Äôs anguished question. Instead, he slipped a consoling arm around his old friend‚Äôs shoulders and led him toward the robing room.",
    "",
    "By the time Marshall finally retired, a bit over a decade later, the assault was well underway. But he never lost his good humor, and even accepted accolades from old adversaries. In 1912, after accidentally admitting three Black lawyers, the American Bar Association adopted a resolution affirming that ‚Äúit has never been contemplated that members of the colored race should become members.‚Äù The rule was not abandoned until 1943. But it took until 1950 ‚Äî just four years before Brown v. Board of Education was decided ‚Äî before the group finally resumed accepting Black members. In August 1992 ‚Äî the last summer of Marshall‚Äôs extraordinary life ‚Äî the A.B.A. named him the first recipient of an award named in his honor. The award was bestowed at a banquet in San Francisco. I was privileged to be among the speakers.",

    "By then the Judge was plainly ailing, but he sat patiently through the endless encomiums, doing his best to smile through the pain. When my turn came, I repeated several of his favorite tales, closing with the same Las Vegas story he told on the night we first met. When I was done, I turned his way to thank him for all the doors he had so brilliantly opened during his unparalleled career. Truth be told, I could hardly finish for the tears.",
    "",
    "We never completed the oral history. Although we strove mightily and wound up with more than 20 hours of tapes, we knew we were racing a clock neither of us dared mention. Yet even as age and illness stole the Judge‚Äôs vitality, in our meetings he remained as cheery as ever. Whatever he might have shared with his intimates, each time I walked through the door of his office, he greeted me with the same twinkle in his eye. On the rare occasions when I ventured to ask after his health, he would turn the question into a joke: ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd known I was going to live so long, I would‚Äôve never given up smoking and drinking.‚Äù",
    "",
    "But although he was tired and would occasionally grimace in obvious discomfort, he was, for the most part, the same peppy and optimistic man I remembered. It was as though he was determined through force of will to teach those around him even how to deal with impending death.",

    "Our final sessions came in the fall of 1992. We had finished the material on his career before the Supreme Court and were starting on his life as a justice. We were supposed to resume the interviews in January 1993, the week before the inauguration of President Bill Clinton, where the Judge had promised to swear in Vice President Al Gore. Then a call from Marshall‚Äôs chambers postponed our next meeting: He was a little under the weather.",
    "",
    "For once the Judge had broken his word, because he didn‚Äôt make the inauguration either. He died a few days later. Before his funeral, he lay in state in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court building, and we who served as law clerks over the years took turns standing watch at the coffin as the public filed past, mourning the passing of a giant.",

    "",
    "And yet we all adored him. The Judge was from an era when a person could get away with being larger than life ‚Äî unlike the present day, when so much of our stultifying public discourse has come to be about joining in unearned moral superiority to look down our noses.",

    "Marshall encouraged us to avoid that attitude ‚Äî just one of his many life lessons. And let me admit to being emotionally invested. For a young man barely out of school, the Judge provided a steadying influence and a sterling example. Thurgood Marshall, whether he knew it or not, was like a second father to me.

    "Gregg Alexander (New Radicals), one of the co-authors of this song, explained its meaning to Billboard magazine, saying, \"The goal was for each lyric and sentiment to be a story and a thought unto itself, but also to the greater mystery of life, which is that we are all just coming and going in this life. We are just a lost star. We are a spark on the horizon.\"",
    "\"Lost Stars\" is performed by the character of Adam Levin in the film \"Begin Again\" (2013). He is a musician, and his girlfriend, Keira Knightley's character, wrote the song for him as a gift and also sang it in the film.",
    "This track was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2015 Critics Choice Award and at the 2015 Academy Awards, but lost both times to \"Glory\" by John Legend and Common from the film \"Selma\" (2015).",
    "When Stevie McCrorie won the fourth series of The Voice UK, he released a cover version of \"Lost Stars\" as his winner's single in April 2015.",
    "Adam Levine performed the song with his band Maroon 5 for the Red Pill Blues Tour (2018).",

    "",
    "On the deluxe edition of the album's track-by-track descriptions on Apple Music, Maroon 5's lead singer, Adam Levine, provided insight on the creation of \"Lost\":",
    "",
    "\"Lost\" is actually one of my favorites we've ever done. I think it just captures everything the band stands for, all in one song. Whether you liked us back then, whether you like us now, whether you'll like us later, I think this is kind of a classic sound that we've always had. And the song, the lyrics actually were a great process and I worked a lot. They took a while, and that's, to me, the most important contribution I think that I made to any record. Just sitting with them and really trying to make sure everybody understood what I was saying and not trying to shroud it too much in any metaphor.[1]",
    "",
    "\"Lost\" is a tropical house-pop song.[2] It is a \"spare, open-hearted ode to finding love in a lonely world\".[3] On May 5, 2021, when the band announced the Target edition of the album, the title of the song was revealed when fans could pre-order it.",
    "",
    "Critical reception[edit]",
    "",
    "In a negative review of Jordi, Kate Solomon of i described both \"Lost\" and another track from the album, \"Echo\", featuring American singer-songwriter Blackbear, as possibly \"the same song\", explaining that \"it is perfectly crafted to please crowds, to slip into your consciousness without you really realising - and if you find yourself buying a new car after listening, then its work here is probably done.[4] Writing for NME, El Hunt reported that Maroon 5 tried to emulate the \"eeriness\" of American singer and songwriter Billie Eilish.[5]",
    "",
    "Live performances[edit]",
    "",
    "On June 10, 2021, the day before Maroon 5 released \"Lost\" and Jordi, they performed the song, as well as another single from the album, \"Beautiful Mistakes\", a collaboration with American rapper Megan Thee Stallion, on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.[6] Although, while recording the album, the full band was not together in the same area, they came together for the performance.",
    "",
    "Music video[edit]",
    "",
    "The official music video premiered alongside the release of the song and album on June 11, 2021.[7] The band members of Maroon 5 are seen performing the song on a beach. Lead singer Adam Levine is later pictured swimming underwater with his wife, Namibian model Behati Prinsloo Levine, who plays the role of a mermaid in the accompanying visuals.[8]",

    "by Luke Pettican",
    "Boy in Space ¬© Eva Pentel",

    "oy in Space‚Äôs quiet confidence is incredibly refreshing; there‚Äôs not even a glimmer of false modesty when he speaks. He believes in his own music which gives you good reason to too. ‚ÄúCold,‚Äù which serves as the follow-up to Boy in Space‚Äôs incredible track ‚Äú7UP,‚Äù sees the artist born Robin Lundb√§ck expand his sonic horizons through a collaboration with producer unheard, while still keeping a firm grip on his own distinct style.",

    "That unique style has see him rightfully already garner a devoted fanbase, who are hooked by his enthralling lyricism and endlessly atmospheric production. Atwood Magazine delved deeply into Boy In Space‚Äôs last release ‚Äú7UP,‚Äù touching on his ability to ‚Äúcleverly combine the wistful romanticism of a coming-of-age movie with the emotional sincerity of a hard-hitting drama to create something truly special.‚Äù",

    "",
    "Somewhat paradoxically ‚ÄúCold‚Äù sees Boy In Space and unheard deliver a soaring summer anthem, that feels perfectly made both for scorching summer days and seemingly endless August nights. Boy In Space‚Äôs R&B influences are more evident on ‚ÄúCold‚Äù than ever before; with the end product being a silky, stylish track that feels effortlessly cool. Boy In Space‚Äôs individuality is by far his biggest selling point, and his ability to combine his own sonic stylings with his own¬† idiosyncratic influences to create mind-blowingly brilliant pop music is unprecedented.",

    "",
    "ATWOOD MAGAZINE: YOUR NEW SINGLE ‚ÄúCOLD‚Äù HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED; HOW DID THE TRACK ORIGINATE?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: Through my label I heard of this producer called Unheard and he sent me the track to the song. I have to like a track for me to actually write on it so I listened to and I was kind of into it. I was like ‚Äúyeah, this could definitely be something.‚Äù But at that moment in time, I had a really bad cold. I was just sort doing nothing; just trying to get well. But my label were like ‚ÄúHey, you should get this song going because you‚Äôve been sick for like 2 weeks.‚Äù",
    "",
    "So I got into the studio and at the beginning I didn‚Äôt really want to write it. But then it went so well. I just started singing melodies over it and I think I finished almost the whole song in around an hour. And it‚Äôs called Cold and I had a cold so it‚Äôs pretty fitting.",
    "",
    "FOR ME, PERSONALLY, WHEN I LISTEN TO SOME YOUR SONGS, I FEEL SUCH A HEAVY SENSE OF NOSTALGIA. 7 UP, SUNSETS, FRIENDS. WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS, DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT LISTENERS MAY TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR SONGS? OR IS IT SOMETHING YOU TRY TO NOT THINK ABOUT?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: Like you said, I‚Äôm trying to almost like paint a visual picture of a moment in a cinematic sort of way. I don‚Äôt know; I just want people to visualise something cool so they can actually see the song. I feel like a lot of songwriters just write words that you can‚Äôt really see and I think it‚Äôs harder to feel something from the song then. If you actually talk about the environment and stuff like that, I think you‚Äôre definitely going to connect better with people.",
    "",
    "‚Äú7UP‚Äù IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG, WHAT FEELINGS OR EMOTIONS WERE YOU TRYING TO ENCAPSULATE WITH THAT SONG?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: I went for like a singer songwriter vibe when I wrote it and it was initially just sort of me playing the guitar. With Unheard (producer), we just had the thought of what if we put a cool sort of trappy urban vibe into a singer songwriter type of way. Almost like Ed Sheehan or something like that. So that‚Äôs what I was going for, a very like dramatic and sweet melody.",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "I LOVE THE NARRATIVES YOU CREATE WITHIN YOUR MUSIC; THE PRODUCTION ON YOUR SONGS IS SO INVITINGLY ATMOSPHERIC. HOW‚ÄôS THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH PRODUCERS TO CRAFT THAT DISTINCT SOUND?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: Actually it‚Äôs been quite easy for me because I only work with people that I know really well. So people like Unheard and my brother, and then like to other producers that I work with that I know really well. All the producers I work with all kind of understand my idea of what I want to do with a song.",
    "",
    "It‚Äôs much harder when you‚Äôre like jumping from session to session because then they‚Äôre like used to doing a lot of like regular pop, which kind of sounds a little bit bland. So I think it‚Äôs just about finding those people that you actually know and they actually know your vision and know what you like.",
    "",
    "IT SOUNDS LIKE IT DID BUT DID FINDING THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO WORK WITH ALL COME TOGETHER QUITE NATURALLY AT THE START?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: Yeah, it has happened very naturally. Like I started working with my brother so obviously we‚Äôd see each other all the time. So it‚Äôs been very very natural actually.",
    "",
    "IN YOUR BIO YOU SAY THAT YOU ALWAYS WRITE YOUR BEST SONGS IN UNDER AN HOUR. WHAT‚ÄôS YOUR TYPICAL SONGWRITING PROCESS LOOK LIKE? HOW DO YOU TYPICALLY START A SONG?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: I‚Äôll usually start with the melody and I don‚Äôt really know what to call it, but I call it word pooping. You just like mumble words when you‚Äôre trying to visualise something. You‚Äôre basically just trying to get all the puzzle pieces of a song together but it‚Äôs usually the melody first.",
    "",
    "So I‚Äôll try to get like a good build with melodies so it builds into the chorus because I do like a big chorus.",
    "",
    "WHEN SOMETHING EMOTIONAL HAPPENS, DO YOU TYPICALLY FEEL THE URGE TO WRITE ABOUT IT STRAIGHT AWAY OR DO YOU LET THE FEELINGS LINGER FOR A WHILE?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: I get writing right away; I think that‚Äôs the best way to go. Like if you do that, there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from changing stuff afterwards if there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre not pleased with. So I‚Äôll just try initially to get something finished instead of being too slow and taking like maybe 4 days to finish a song. I like the fast process. It might just be me as well because I have like no patience at all.",
    "",
    "YOU WERE BORN IN A SMALL TOWN IN SWEDEN; HOW DO YOU THINK BEING FROM THERE HAS AFFECTED YOUR MUSIC, AND YOU AS AN ARTIST?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: I think its definitely affected me pop-wise because of Swedish pop. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm on the country side and there‚Äôs bluegrass music everywhere and everyone‚Äôs drinking moonshine. It‚Äôs still like a city and it‚Äôs still up to date with music. So I don‚Äôt really know how it‚Äôs affected me but I think it‚Äôs given me a great platform to be able to express myself through music: just playing in bands and stuff like that.",

    "WHERE DID THE IDEA FOR YOUR MONIKER COME FROM? AND WHEN DID YOU REALISE THAT YOU WANTED TO RELEASE MUSIC USING ONE?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: I think that I‚Äôve always known I wanted to have my own project, like in the back of my head I always knew I would do it some day. I had a band before Boy In Space and it was creatively pulling me in directions in places I didn‚Äôt want to go. When that project ended it felt so good and natural to just start my own project so I was able to do what I really really loved.",
    "",

    "Boy in Space: We‚Äôre working on something right now actually. I think the vision is to release an EP. Whether that‚Äôs in the fall now or in the beginning of next year, we don‚Äôt know yet. But it‚Äôs definitely coming and I think it‚Äôs going to be amazing because I really love the songs.",
    "",
    "WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE LOOKING TO CRAFT A CREATIVE PROJECT LIKE AN EP, ARE YOU LOOKING TO CREATE LIKE A NARRATIVE WITHIN THAT? OR IS IT JUST SORT OF LIKE SONGS YOU LIKE THE MOST?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: I‚Äôm very much like a song kind of guy. I listen to songs but not that many projects. We definitely have like a red thread throughout the sound of the EP but necessarily there‚Äôs not like a story that follows through the whole EP. But it‚Äôs definitely about love; I‚Äôll tell you that straight off the bat. But I think my vision for the EP is to just make it feel like a studio album so it doesn‚Äôt feel like comprised or cheap at all.",
    "",
    "I just want to release an EP that will like blow people away and have people think like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs serious and actually a great songwriter and he actually wants to make like hits.‚Äù I think that was like my vision, just to start with a bang and then see what happens.",

    "IN WHAT WAYS DOES THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF WORKING ON NEW MUSIC NOW, OR SOME OF YOUR LATEST RELEASES, FEEL DIFFERENT TO HOW IT FELT WHEN YOU WERE ORIGINALLY WORKING ON MUSIC?",
    "",
    "Boy in Space: I think the thing that has changed is like the more time you spend on a project, you kind of understand more what you want to do. I think the biggest difference is like now I‚Äôm kind of like finding myself within Boy In Space and with that, I never wanted to find Boy In Space and be like I only do this. I‚Äôd rather do like a lot of different things but I also think right now we‚Äôre finding the right style and figuring out how we want to approach things. Like it‚Äôs going to come together as well with the live set¬† so I think we‚Äôre like almost there. We‚Äôre still in the midst of finding the whole project but it‚Äôs getting there gradually.",

You can see it‚Äôs from him, like he actually wants to do it. I feel like a lot of the acts you see, you can tell that a manager has totally told them to do something. I really admire people like that and people that are actually in the studio working and writing stuff as well.",
    "",
    "I think that goes for all the artists that I do like, I think it‚Äôs something I can really relate to because I am a songwriter and I want to be able to express myself in my own kind of way. I think that‚Äôs what I gravitate to, whether that‚Äôs with like the Red Hot Chilli Peppers or Khalid. It doesn‚Äôt really matter, it‚Äôs just cool when you can express yourself in your own way. It doesn‚Äôt have to be like super edgy or super out there; it can still be pop and it can still be still be played on the radio.

Sometimes though if there‚Äôs like horrible production it makes it harder to listen to because I‚Äôm quite picky. I‚Äôve been very spoiled by working with a lot of great producers so sometimes like bad production can just like ruin a song for me.

    "Boy in Space: Yeah, there‚Äôs like huge artists that just do that. Like they‚Äôre playing huge festivals and they don‚Äôt have a band. I understand it if you‚Äôre doing a certain type of music like EDM or some kind of hip-hop then I get that. But I feel like a lot of people take the easy route with that because it‚Äôs cheaper and stuff like that. So I‚Äôd rather make a great show so people want to come back and see me.",

So I was like you need to have a go at this, like I knew he could do it well and he was like super hungry for it as well because he had the idea of of starting to artist project Tiger Tom where he can just like produce and be like free. Kind of like Boy In Space but more EDM vibes.",

Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking forward to the most. I think that‚Äôs the goal. Once I‚Äôm there, I‚Äôll see what happens. I‚Äôll always continue writing music and performing, whatever happens though. I think that‚Äôs the vision for it.",

    " 12 MIN READ",
    "Boy In Space has released his video for¬†‚ÄúCold‚Äù ‚Äì¬†a song he teamed up with fellow Swedish artist, 17-year old producer¬†unheard,¬†to create.",
    "The track, which appeared on¬†Spotify‚Äôs Fresh & Chill¬†playlist ‚Äì where¬†Boy In Space appeared as the cover artist -and¬†New Music Friday in 28 countries,¬†along with¬†Apple Music‚Äôs Best Of The Week playlist in 7 countries,¬†is filled with cinematic lyrics and lush vocals as it explores a couple on thin ice and the difficulties of moving on from a relationship that never had a chance to truly begin. Using¬†Boy In Space as a vehicle to share life experiences and ponder truth, love and the complications of adolescence,¬†Robin Lundb√§ck,¬†explains that ‚ÄúCold‚Äù is about ‚Äúbeing in the middle of a very intense moment with someone you love, where you feel betrayed and there are so many raw emotions and things happen very fast.‚Äù",
    "¬†",
    "Since his debut release, Boy In Space¬†has gathered over¬†7.2 million streams¬†as¬†Lundb√§ck¬†attempts to illustrate the intensities of youth, the cold sting of heartbreak, the suffocation of betrayal and the fiery passion of young love through ‚ÄúCold‚Äù and previous single, ‚Äú7UP.‚Äú",
    "The moniker ‚ÄúBoy In Space‚Äù itself is a metaphor for how¬†he navigates and untangles these emotions.¬†‚ÄúI can be crazy and all over the place at times. I was always the class clown in school and although I got along with everyone,¬†I was never really at the top of the class,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo¬†‚ÄòBoy In Space‚Äô¬†has a very literal meaning to it. Although my songs can be sad, if you meet me, you‚Äôll find that I‚Äôm full of energy and¬†actually pretty happy (most of the time). So in a not so literal way,¬†Boy In Space¬†has become the space where I‚Äôm¬†able¬†to go to express those sad and darker feelings.‚Äú",

    "On 29 April 2021, Coldplay confirmed on their social media that a new single called \"Higher Power\" would be released on 7 May.[7][8] The song was produced by Max Martin, whom the band called \"a true wonder of the universe\".[7] During an interview with Mark Savage of BBC News, lead vocalist Chris Martin, who is in no relation to Max, said, \"I came up with the title first, but struggled to find the melody and lyrics to go with it. Then one day I was staying in this place and the sink was very resonant. And so I started hitting the sink [to make] this beat... and then I went to the piano keyboard, and the song just landed in one go\".[9]",
    "",
    "He also explained that \"the song is about trying to find the astronaut in all of us, the person that can do amazing things\".[10] The singer later told Zoe Ball that the track had intergalactic origins, saying: \"We've been trying to imagine what music might sound like on other planets, and try to imagine being those other acts, so we're not thinking of ourselves as being the band Coldplay from England\", he explained.[11] On 15 June 2021, Coldplay released an acoustic version of the song.[12]",

    "An audio visualizer for \"Higher Power\", which was directed by Paul Dugdale, premiered on Coldplay's YouTube channel at 12:01¬†a.m. BST on 7 May 2021, coinciding with the single's release.[13][14] It features the band performing on an empty lot as alien holograms dance to the tune.[15] Branded as a form of \"extraterrestrial transmission\", the band previewed the video to French European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet aboard the International Space Station prior to its public release.[16][17] On 19 May, an official lyric video directed by Pilar Zeta and Victor Scorrano was released.[18] Two weeks later, Coldplay confirmed on their social media that the official version, which was directed by Dave Meyers, would be released on 8 June 2021.[19] The official video was revealed to be the first as part of a three-part \"melodic orbit\", entitled Music of the Spheres, which is rumoured to be the title of their ninth album. The phrase also refers to the intro track used in the official video, as well as during the Live at Worthy Farm livestream and their performance at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend.[20] The video was choreographed by Seoul-based Kim Boram, and features members of his dance troupe, Ambiguous Dance Company.[21][22]",

    "Live performances[edit]",
    "",
    "On 2 May, the first live performance of \"Higher Power\" was announced to be held at American Idol's 9 May episode. The Official Charts Company informed on 3 May that the band would perform the track to open the 41st Brit Awards, which was recorded on a barge on the River Thames by The O2 Arena.[23][24] Coldplay included the song, along with a track titled \"Human Heart\", on their set for Glastonbury Festival's special livestream event on 22 May, which was filmed at Worthy Farm.[25] On 28 May, BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend released the band's performance of \"Higher Power\" recorded at Whitby Abbey in North Yorkshire, England.[26] On 16 June, Coldplay performed the acoustic rendition live for the first time on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in New York City.[27]",
    "",
    "Critical reception[edit]",
    "",
    "Ella Kemp from NME rated the song 4/5 stars and noted that ‚ÄúThe track takes everything Chris Martin and co. have learned from a lifetime of dreaming and finally launches their talent into outer space ‚Äì literally. 'Higher Power' is best appreciated through the sheer force of the melody, giving you the rush of hurtling into the atmosphere [...]. For a band so often shackled by their emotional transparency, [the song] is an exciting leap forward‚Äù.[10] Halle Kiefer from Vulture noted similarities with Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\", while also complimenting the song by saying that \"[in] comparison, 'Higher Power' wins out by a few hundred kilometers\".[16]",

    "Song Meaning",
    "This songs seem to be about a relationship that is very meaningful. But the guy seems to be treating her not too well, for some reason. And maybe he is thinking about leaving. She is mad at him for many reasons, for his weakness. The chores (I'll be a thorn in your side...) just seems to be saying that if he leaves she will never forgive him and that she will just be something painful to him or make sure that she is something painful to him... She seems to be talking out of anger. And my favorite part is ''We sink, we lift our love''. It is a nice contrast with the rest of the chorus that sounds spiteful. Just saying that even if everything goes wrong and they are lost and sinking they will lift their love, so that it doesn't sink with them. As if they can actually go throuhg anything, they just have to hold on.",

    "listened to this song about a million times, never really thought deeply about the lyrics, perhaps I'm slow on the uptake with this one.",
    "",
    "But it hit me recently- 'if we sink// we lift our love\"- to me means means that there love exists only when they fall away from each other. I like the visual affect of 'sink' vs 'lift' and I've interpret litrally in my head, the people are broken/sunken but the love is only ever more exhaulted. Sometimes the best thing you can do for each other is to leave each other behind, allow each other to self-distruct and fall into our bad habits, do your worst. I relate it to that age old concept of love as being this mystical outside force that exists outside of the people it brings together. Obviously not all love works out in reality, it has the power to lift you with it or leave you behind. either way, the love doesn't stop existing.",
    "",
    "On a deeper level, it makes me think of the ancients who made the distinguishment between 'earthly love' and the highest most exhaulted form of love. They believed that there was a higher experience of love that humans, by virtue of existing in the sinful/flawed earthily world, were not predisposed to. They believed in varying degrees of love and that through the highest forms of love humans could transcend their flawed earthly state, tap into something other wordly. However, the highest, purest form of love was truly believed to be something of the Gods and only accessed after death.",
    "",
    "Either way, I interpret the song in a positive way, no love is wasted, yes sometimes it doesn't work out in reality but it's an experience and depth of emotion you reach and it continues somewhere itself. It's like the cliche every failure is a lesson.",

    "sounds like a long fling/love with someone. To be a thorn in the side to someone, is someone that you struggle with time and time again. Life is so wonderful and crazy when in love, but there are no rules when it come to matters of the heart/love. If we sink, it will still be ok. It doesn't sound like they want to give up just yet though.",

    "But it hit me recently- 'if we sink// we lift our love\"- to me means means that there love exists only when they fall away from each other. I like the visual affect of 'sink' vs 'lift' and I've interpret litrally in my head, the people are broken/sunken but the love is only ever more exhaulted. Sometimes the best thing you can do for each other is to leave each other behind, allow each other to self-distruct and fall into our bad habits, do your worst. I relate it to that age old concept of love as being this mystical outside force that exists outside of the people it brings together. Obviously not all love works out in reality, it has the power to lift you with it or leave you behind. either way, the love doesn't stop existing.",

    "On a deeper level, it makes me think of the ancients who made the distinguishment between 'earthly love' and the highest most exhaulted form of love. They believed that there was a higher experience of love that humans, by virtue of existing in the sinful/flawed earthily world, were not predisposed to. They believed in varying degrees of love and that through the highest forms of love humans could transcend their flawed earthly state, tap into something other wordly. However, the highest, purest form of love was truly believed to be something of the Gods and only accessed after death.",

    "Either way, I interpret the song in a positive way, no love is wasted, yes sometimes it doesn't work out in reality but it's an experience and depth of emotion you reach and it continues somewhere itself. It's like the cliche every failure is a lesson.",

    "It's interesting to see that many of you view the line \"I'll be a thorn in your side till you die\" as a positive statement. To me it has obvious negative connotations, something like \"If we carry on like this, you'll regret your decision to stay with me for the rest of your life\". To me this is clearly a breakup song and a brilliant one at that.",

    "ByEmily Todd VanDerWerff",
    "12/03/13 1:00PM",
    "Comments (54)",
    "",
    "In Hear This, A.V. Club writers sing the praises of songs they know well‚Äîsome inspired by a weekly theme and some not, but always songs worth hearing",
    "",
    "ADVERTISEMENT",
    "",
    "Was there a better description of love in 2013 than ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be a thorn in your side till you die‚Äù? That lyric, from Chvrches cacophonously beautiful ‚ÄúWe Sink,‚Äù the second track on The Bones Of What You Believe, was applied to a self-destructive, codependent relationship dissected in the song‚Äôs lyrics, but it might as well apply to any relationship serious enough to leave bruises, a list that includes even the best marriage of all time. That‚Äôs the brilliance of ‚ÄúWe Sink‚Äù: The verses take the short view, two people trapped in a locked room together with no way out, but the chorus looks ahead to the future, where even if one or both escape that room, the experience will always haunt them.",
    "",
    "Art frequently presents love as something perfect and wonderful, a visitation from the heavens that just so happens to alight on two humans at just the right time. And to be sure, there are times and places where that‚Äôs exactly the kind of song you want to hear, where all you need is to turn up the radio and sing along to something schmoopy. And there are plenty of songs that take the opposite view, the ‚Äúfuck you!‚Äù songs to former lovers who‚Äôve spurned the singer, meant to assuage pain in the face of a break-up.",
    "",
    "Far less common is the genre into which ‚ÄúWe Sink‚Äù properly fits: the ‚Äúfuck you for not letting me go‚Äù song, a subset of music that includes such classics as Fleetwood Mac‚Äôs ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù and The Mountain Goats‚Äô ‚ÄúNo Children.‚Äù Any relationship will reach a point‚Äîeven if just for a moment‚Äîwhere both parties are essentially ready to call it quits, but nobody‚Äôs ready to pull the pin on the grenade, because staying together is just easier than falling apart. ‚ÄúWe Sink‚Äù works because it puts this sentiment in the ethereal vocals of Lauren Mayberry, who sounds like she‚Äôs floating above the dissolution of her own relationship, not just able to see all the pain it‚Äôs causing the two people in it but all of the pain it will cause her and her lover in the future, even if the two of them find their way to a reconciliation or a graceful exit.",
    "",
    "The lyrics are simple to the point of abstraction. Anyone who‚Äôs been in love that‚Äôs curdled has been in this situation, to the point where all Mayberry needs to say is ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come apart, and you made me‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe are gonna fall if you lead us,‚Äù and the listener knows exactly what she means. Best of all is the bridge, in which chanting background singers repeat ‚ÄúSay, say, say‚Äù while Mayberry sings, ‚ÄúCan you not see why/ Love was/ That you see cry,‚Äù words that almost form a complete statement but not quite, even as they get across perfectly the endless vortex the singer and her lover are trapped in.",

    "Yet it‚Äôs that chorus I keep coming back to. There are scars I still bear from high school girlfriends and memories of vicious nightlong fights with a wife I‚Äôve had a 99.999 percent happy marriage with. We all have thorns, and we are all thorns to someone. Mayberry and her lover might find a way out, but they‚Äôll always be sinking together.",
